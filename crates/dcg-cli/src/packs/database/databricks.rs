//! Databricks CLI patterns - protections against destructive `databricks`
//! commands (GH#333).
//!
//! Initial high-value scope, per the pack request:
//! - `account workspaces delete` (deletes an entire workspace)
//! - `bundle destroy` (removes every resource a bundle deployed;
//!   `--auto-approve` skips the CLI's own confirmation)
//! - `workspace delete` / `workspace rm` (recursive and single-object)
//! - `fs rm` (DBFS / Unity Catalog Volumes; recursive and single-object)
//! - `clusters permanent-delete`
//! - `secrets delete-scope` / `delete-secret` / `delete-acl`
//! - `api delete` (arbitrary REST DELETE, like the generic `gh api` rule)
//! - resource deletes: jobs, pipelines, repos, cluster-policies,
//!   instance-pools, warehouses, tokens
//!
//! Follow-up scope (GH#359) — Unity Catalog hierarchy and account identities:
//! - `metastores delete` / `account metastores delete` (with or without
//!   `--force`, which deletes even a non-empty metastore)
//! - `catalogs delete` / `schemas delete` (Critical with `--force`, which
//!   overrides the non-empty check; High otherwise)
//! - `apps delete` (Critical with `--auto-approve`, which skips the CLI's own
//!   confirmation and can destroy a whole Apps project's resources)
//! - account identity deletion: `account users-v2 | service-principals |
//!   groups-v2 delete` (account-wide blast radius)
//!
//! Global targeting flags (`-p/--profile <name>`, `-t/--target <name>`) may
//! appear between `databricks` and the command group; the shared
//! flag-consuming prefix keeps every rule matching regardless of their
//! position, so `databricks -p prod workspace delete ...` is still caught.
