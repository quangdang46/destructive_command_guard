//! `BigQuery` protection: the `bq` CLI and `GoogleSQL`.
//!
//! Three `BigQuery` specifics drive the rules here, and each one makes a
//! naive port of the `PostgreSQL`/Snowflake packs wrong:
//!
//! - A *dataset* is a `SCHEMA` in `GoogleSQL`. `DROP SCHEMA` is therefore the
//!   dataset-level catastrophe, not a namespace tidy-up.
//! - `GoogleSQL` **requires** a `WHERE` clause on `DELETE`/`UPDATE`, so
//!   `WHERE TRUE` is the idiomatic full-table spelling. A `delete-without-where`
//!   rule modelled on `PostgreSQL` would never fire.
//! - Time travel (2–7 days) is the only undo. Settings that shorten it —
//!   `--max_time_travel_hours`, `expiration_timestamp` — destroy the recovery
//!   path itself, so they are destructive in their own right.
//!
//! CLI rules are scoped with `executables = ["bq"]`: `bq` is a two-letter
//! token that shows up in prose, filenames, and other commands, so these must
//! only fire when the resolved argv0 really is `bq`. The `GoogleSQL` rules are
//! unscoped because SQL reaches us through files, pipes, and heredocs as well
//! as `bq query` arguments.
//!
//! **Scope note.** Snowflake additionally carries a dialect-aware argv
//! recovery layer (`collect_dialect_snowflake_flows`: PowerShell call
//! operators, dynamic executable spellings, CLI size budgets). That is not
//! ported here. The consequence is bounded: destructive `GoogleSQL` still
//! blocks, because those rules match the raw command text regardless of how
//! argv was spelled — what is missing is the extra depth of recovering `bq`
//! argv under exotic dialect forms, which would refine attribution rather
//! than change a verdict.
