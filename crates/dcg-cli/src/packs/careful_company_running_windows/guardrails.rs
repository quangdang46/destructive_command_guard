//! Tampering with the controls that watch the agent — including dcg itself.
//!
//! An agent running with tool-permission prompts disabled has exactly one thing
//! standing between a bad idea and a bad outcome: the guardrails. This sub-pack
//! treats *removing a control* as a first-class destructive act, on the
//! reasoning that a command which disables monitoring is more consequential than
//! most of the commands the monitoring would have caught.
//!
//! Three groups:
//!
//!   - **Security controls**: Microsoft Defender (`Set-MpPreference -Disable*`,
//!     `-ExclusionPath`), the Windows firewall, EDR and event-log services,
//!     BitLocker, `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, and PowerShell script-block
//!     logging.
//!   - **Audit trail**: `wevtutil cl`, `Clear-EventLog`, `auditpol /clear`.
//!     Clearing a security log is the step that makes everything before it
//!     unreviewable, which is why it is Critical even though it destroys no
//!     business data.
//!   - **dcg and the agent's own configuration**: `DCG_BYPASS`, `dcg uninstall`,
//!     allowlist grants (`dcg allowlist add`, `dcg allow-once`), the runtime
//!     config overrides (`DCG_DISABLE`, `DCG_PACKS`, `DCG_CONFIG`,
//!     `DCG_POLICY_DEFAULT_MODE=warn|log`, `DCG_POLICY_OBSERVE_UNTIL`,
//!     `DCG_HEREDOC_ENABLED=false`), and edits to the agent hook files
//!     (`.claude/settings.json` and the equivalents for Codex, Cursor, Gemini,
//!     Copilot, and Grok). A guard an agent can switch off is not a guard —
//!     and each of these switches it off for the *next* command, quietly.
//!     Diagnosis stays open: `dcg explain`, `dcg allowlist list`, and
//!     `dcg allowlist validate` are all whitelisted.
//!
//! It also covers **unreviewed remote code**: `iwr … | iex`,
//! `powershell -EncodedCommand <base64>`, and the LOLBins that fetch and run a
//! remote payload (`mshta https://…`, `regsvr32 /i:http…`, `rundll32
//! javascript:`). These belong here rather than with the upload rules because
//! the control they defeat is code review and supply-chain policy: whatever
//! runs was never seen by a person, and on a `-EncodedCommand` line it cannot
//! be seen even in hindsight.
//!
//! Read-only inspection of every one of these — `Get-MpComputerStatus`,
//! `Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `wevtutil el`, `auditpol /get`, `manage-bde
//! -status`, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` — is explicitly whitelisted, because
//! answering "is protection on?" is exactly what a careful operator should be
//! able to ask.
//!
//! Note that `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1` (a per-process
//! flag used by countless legitimate installers) is **not** matched. Only the
//! persistent `Set-ExecutionPolicy` is.
