//! GitHub Platform pack - protections for destructive GitHub CLI (`gh`) operations.
//!
//! This pack targets high-impact operations when managing GitHub repositories,
//! gists, releases, and other platform resources:
//! - Deleting repositories
//! - Changing repository visibility
//! - Archiving repositories
//! - Deleting gists
//! - Deleting releases
//! - Deleting issues
//! - Deleting SSH keys

    // Regex logic:
    // Match `gh`
    // Match optional global flags: `--flag` or `--flag value`
    // Ensure the flag value isn't one of our target subcommands (repo, gist, etc.)
    // Match the target subcommand and action
    //
    // The option VALUE alternative is `(?!--?[A-Za-z])[^\s;&|]+` — "any token
    // that is not itself option-shaped". With a bare `\S+` there, a flag token
    // could parse either as a new option or as the previous option's value, so
    // `gh -a -b -c ...` had exponentially many parses. These patterns carry a
    // lookahead, so they run on the backtracking engine, and
    // `CompiledRegex::is_match` maps a backtrack-limit error to `false`
    // (src/packs/regex_engine.rs) — i.e. a pathological input would have
    // failed OPEN.
    //
    // The lookahead is the exact complement of the option alternative
    // (`--?[A-Za-z]...`), so the two are disjoint and the ambiguity is gone,
    // while values that merely START with a dash without being options
    // (`--jq -.x`, a negative number) still match. A blunter
    // `[^-\s;&|][^\s;&|]*` would also be unambiguous but would silently lose
    // those.

    // Subcommands to look ahead for: repo|gist|release|issue|ssh-key|secret|variable|run|auth|status|api
    // We use a robust value matcher that handles quoted strings to prevent bypasses.
