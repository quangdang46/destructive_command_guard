#![allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]
//! Pack system for modular command blocking.
//!
//! This module provides the infrastructure for organizing patterns into "packs"
//! that can be enabled or disabled based on user configuration.
//!
//! # Pack Hierarchy
//!
//! Packs are organized in a two-level hierarchy:
//! - Category (e.g., "database", "kubernetes")
//! - Sub-pack (e.g., "database.postgresql", "kubernetes.kubectl")
//!
//! Enabling a category enables all its sub-packs. Sub-packs can be individually
//! disabled even if their parent category is enabled.
