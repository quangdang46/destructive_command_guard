//! Rebase recovery mode — narrowly relax `git checkout --` / `git restore` blocks
//! when the user is actively recovering from a failed `git pull --rebase` flow.
//!
//! ## Problem
//!
//! When `git pull --rebase` fails partway (unstaged changes, stash-pop
//! conflict, interrupted rebase), the standard recovery path is often
//! `git checkout -- .` or `git restore <paths>`. Both are normally blocked
//! by dcg (rules `core.git:checkout-discard` and `core.git:restore-worktree`),
//! which leaves AI agents stuck and forced to ask the user to run the
//! command by hand. See issue #104.
//!
//! ## Solution
//!
//! Two complementary signals unlock the recovery path, both narrow and
//! bounded so the default safety guarantee is preserved outside of a
//! genuine recovery window:
//!
//! 1. **Active rebase state (automatic, zero-config).** If `.git/rebase-merge/`
//!    or `.git/rebase-apply/` exists, a rebase is in progress. In this state
//!    the discard operations are the documented recovery path, not a
//!    dangerous mistake — so dcg allows them with an informational note
//!    to stderr instead of a hard block.
//!
//! 2. **Explicit permit cookie (opt-in, short-lived).** The agent (or user)
//!    runs `dcg rebase-recover`, which writes a timestamp file into
//!    `.dcg/rebase-recovery-permit`. For the next 120 seconds (or until the
//!    next matching operation is allowed through — whichever comes first),
//!    `git checkout --` and `git restore` are allowed. This covers the
//!    common post-rebase case where the rebase itself already succeeded
//!    but a `git stash pop` left the worktree messy.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! - The permit is scoped to the current repository's `.dcg/` directory.
//! - The permit is single-use (consumed on first successful allow).
//! - The permit expires after a short TTL (default 120s).
//! - Outside of both signals, the block path is unchanged. The safety
//!   guarantee for `core.git:checkout-discard` / `core.git:restore-worktree`
//!   still holds for every command that is not part of a rebase recovery.
