//! Registry-wide suggestion self-consistency (#316).
//!
//! A denial that recommends a command the same pack blocks is a dead end: the
//! agent reads the block message, tries the suggestion, is denied again, and
//! gives up (or worse, starts reshaping commands until something passes).
//!
//! Every `PatternSuggestion` in every built-in pack must therefore be either:
//! - actually runnable — the pack that offered it does not deny it, or
//! - explicitly constructed with `PatternSuggestion::gated`, which renders an
//!   unmistakable "dcg gates this too — it needs explicit approval" marker.
//!
//! Placeholders like `{path}` or `<owner>/<repo>` are substituted with
//! concrete, realistic values before evaluation, so the regexes see the same
//! bytes a user pasting the suggestion would produce.

/// instantiated. Rules that fire *because* the target is a root/home/sensitive
