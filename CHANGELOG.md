## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.14.0) -- 2026-09-01 [Release]

### Added

- **Databricks pack rules, precision heredoc interpreter scoping, and strict
  git scoping.** New rules cover destructive Databricks CLI operations
  (#357, #359); basename-evidence matching closes the false-negative wave
  from #360/#361; heredoc interpreter scoping stops inert heredoc bodies
  from tripping embedded-language analysis (#363); and `strict_git` rules
  are scoped to actual `git` executables (#362), eliminating the
  `ls .git/rebase-merge` class of false positives.
- **Doctor per-harness enablement checks (#368).** `dcg doctor` now verifies
  the gate is actually reachable, not merely installed: a new `codex_hook`
  check distinguishes Enabled / never-approved / Disabled / NotRegistered
  states in Codex's `hooks.json` + `config.toml` trust model (`--fix` flips
  `enabled = true` on an existing entry only — doctor never forges a trust
  entry), and the OpenCode check byte-compares the installed `dcg-guard.js`
  plugin against canonical source, so an edited or stubbed plugin surfaces
  as OUTDATED OR MODIFIED instead of passing as healthy. Both checks fail
  doctor (and `--strict`) when the hook is present but unreachable.

### Fixed

- **Rescue home-subtree moves and quoted Trash soft-deletes (#371).**
  `mv-sensitive-source-root-home` and `rm-rf-root-home` each recommended the
  command the other denies, so no move-then-cleanup could complete inside a
  home directory. Two narrowly-scoped safe patterns fix the deadlock:
  in-home renames (both sides ≥ required depth under the same home root, no
  dotfile trees, no `..`, no dynamic expansion) and the #244 Trash rescue
  with quoted tokens — quoting was previously a one-directional deny
  amplifier even though filenames with spaces must be quoted. Rule prose now
  recommends only remediations that actually run for a home path.
- **Deny `git show <ref>:<path>` redirected onto the same `<path>` (#373).**
  The checkout-ref-discard remediation recommended `git show` without
  warning that redirecting output back onto the shown path reaches the
  identical overwrite the rule denies — a live agent session followed that
  guidance and overwrote an uncommitted file. A new sibling rule
  `show-redirect-overwrite-source` pins redirect target == shown path via
  backreference (covers `>`, `>>`, `>|`), while captures to a new file and
  the bare view stay allowed; structured suggestions registered for the new
  rule.
- **Treat `git apply` patch heredocs as structured stdin data (#374).** A
  quoted heredoc containing an ordinary unified diff fed to
  `git apply --cached` was denied as an unknown embedded language; `git`
  parses a stdin patch as data in every mode. The structured git stdin-sink
  proof (#136/#277 machinery) now covers `apply`, with fail-closed edges
  preserved (`--unsafe-paths`, config-bearing invocations, PATH/alias
  overrides still refuse the proof).
- **Cover dashed-builtin spellings narrowed by #362 scoping (#367).** Scoping
  strict_git rules to `executables=["git"]` silently dropped `git-rebase` /
  `git-push --force` style dashed spellings; each rule's executables list now
  includes its dashed form and the push-master/push-main regexes learned the
  `git-push` spelling, with tests pinning both the restored coverage and the
  intact #362 narrowing.
- **Stop hook-mode test spawns from self-healing the caller's real agent hook
  (#372).** Running the test suite could install the freshly built dev binary
  as a global Claude Code PreToolUse hook on the developer's machine; the
  four integration targets that spawn dcg in hook mode now set
  `DCG_SELF_HEAL_HOOK=0`, keeping the suite hermetic.

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: flate2 1.1.10, tru 0.2.4, which 8.0.6 (PR #369).

---

## [v0.13.9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.9) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Fixed

- **Close Windows executable-spelling gaps in scoped pack rules.** Executable
  scoping now treats `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.com` like `.exe` in the native Cmd
  dialect, matching the documented contract and preserving protection through
  `CALL`, `IF`, `START`, and `FOR`. The Infisical and disclosure rules also
  match case-insensitive Windows executable names and suffixes explicitly.
- **Complete opt-in secret-disclosure coverage without blocking help.** The
  disclosure pack now catches redirected bare Infisical listings, AWS Secrets
  Manager batch reads, and all decrypted SSM parameter-read variants. Safe
  `-h`, `--help`, and AWS `help` invocations remain available, including when
  nested secret reads still require denial. The pack now retains service-tier
  attribution ahead of the broader Windows egress preset.

---

## [v0.13.8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.8) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Added

- **Add explicit Infisical and transcript-disclosure protection.** The new
  `secrets.infisical` pack blocks destructive secret, folder, dynamic-lease,
  and local-reset operations. The separate exact opt-in `secret_disclosure` pack
  blocks value-emitting reads across Infisical, 1Password, Doppler, Vault, AWS
  Secrets Manager, and decrypted SSM while leaving metadata inspection and
  direct process injection available. Provider packs retain their existing
  mutation-only policy unless disclosure protection is explicitly enabled;
  enabling the `secrets` category alone does not activate it.
  ([#355])

### Fixed

- **Treat shell line continuations as syntax, not dynamic `mv` paths.** Literal
  multi-file `mv` commands split with backslash-LF or backslash-CRLF now match
  their single-line equivalent. Variables, substitutions, doubled
  backslashes, and in-path escapes remain fail-closed. ([#356])

## [v0.13.7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.7) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Release integrity

- **Ship portable Linux archives without macOS metadata members.** DSR now
  disables extended attributes as well as macOS copyfile metadata while
  packaging tar archives. This prevents `._dcg` AppleDouble members from
  appearing when GNU tar reads a Linux archive, so the strict installer sees
  exactly the one root-level `dcg` binary it requires. v0.13.7 supersedes the
  Linux artifacts from v0.13.6; the product changes are otherwise identical.

---

## [v0.13.6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.6) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

The macOS and Windows artifacts passed the public install gate, but the Linux
archives included a macOS `._dcg` metadata member and were correctly rejected
by the strict installer. Use v0.13.7 or newer on Linux.

### Fixed

- **Resolve literal executable assignments before per-pack evaluation.**
  Straight-line POSIX forms such as `d=docker; $d system prune -af` now bind
  the later segment to Docker and report `containers.docker:system-prune`
  instead of borrowing flags into an unrelated Git rule. Dynamic assignments
  remain fail-closed, and evaluated segments cannot hide a destructive command
  later in the chain. ([#288], [#289])
- **Allow new literal files inside home-directory worktrees.** A truncating
  redirect to a currently absent literal target in an existing VCS worktree is
  treated as creation. Existing files, symlinks, dynamic paths, missing
  parents, system paths, and `.git` internals remain blocked; `dcg create-new`
  remains the race-free exclusive-create path. ([#337])
- **Guard GitHub repository visibility changes.** `gh repo edit --visibility`
  now requires review under the GitHub platform pack. ([#354])

## [v0.13.5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.5) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Security

- **Fail closed when an update installer checksum is unavailable.** The Unix
  and Windows update paths now refuse to execute a downloaded installer unless
  its tag-matched SHA256 sidecar is present and valid. This removes the legacy
  fallback that could describe an update as verified after continuing past a
  missing installer checksum. ([#352])

[#352]: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/352

---

## [v0.13.4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.4) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Release integrity

- **Verify tag-pinned installer bytes before execution.** The real fleet gate
  now downloads the same tagged `install.sh` / `install.ps1` bytes used by
  `dcg update`, requires their adjacent SHA256 sidecars, and verifies the digest
  before invoking either script.
- **Ship signed installer scripts in the strict DSR contract.** Both installers,
  their checksum sidecars, and their current-key minisign signatures join the
  six signed binary archives in the exact public asset set. This closes the
  installer-authentication gap found while replaying the v0.12.5 updater path.
  ([#353])

[#353]: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/353

---

## [v0.13.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.3) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Release integrity

- **Bind strict DSR binaries to their exact tagged source.** DSR builds from an
  authenticated tracked-byte snapshot that intentionally excludes `.git`, so
  v0.13.2 could not expose the full commit SHA required by dcg's absolute
  latency certificate. DSR now passes its independently verified tag and SHA
  into every native build; dcg validates both before embedding them. This
  superseding patch preserves v0.13.2's current-key signatures while restoring
  the source-to-binary proof required by the release gate.

---

## [v0.13.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.2) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

### Release integrity

- **Route DSR signing through dcg's current release authority.** The v0.13.1
  archives were signed on the build coordinator with dcg's retired
  `36B847D11BA5A0D0` key, so current installers correctly rejected them. This
  superseding patch is signed on the dedicated signing host with the embedded
  `69B3955C8D2E62A8` trust root; the product and safety behavior from v0.13.1 is
  otherwise unchanged.

---

## [v0.13.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.1) -- 2026-08-27 [Release]

This patch release was intended to turn the post-v0.13.0 safety and release
hardening into a clean, signed distribution. Its published archives were
mistakenly signed with dcg's retired key and are therefore rejected by current
installers; v0.13.2 supersedes it. The underlying changes substantially improve
diagnostics, external-pack validation, OMP lifecycle safety, and the quality of
suggested alternatives after a block.

### Security

- **Unverified commands no longer fail open for unattended agents.** Commands
  that cannot be evaluated completely, including deadline exhaustion and
  incomplete nested evaluation, retain an indeterminate decision and are
  denied when the host cannot ask for review.
- **Filesystem coverage now catches unbounded non-recursive glob deletion.**
  Risky `rm` expansions no longer evade the recursive-delete rules merely by
  omitting `-r`; bounded scratch-directory operations retain their narrow safe
  path.
- **External packs validate executable scope canonically.** Pack authors get a
  concrete validation error when a rule's declared executable scope and its
  regex semantics disagree, preventing broad or misleading attribution.
- **OMP's native bridge has a tighter trust boundary.** The generated extension
  binds to the installed `dcg` binary, rejects lossy executable paths, preserves
  signal provenance, bounds child observation and stream resources, and keeps
  host-owned hook fields during self-healing.

### Added

- **Pack validation is wired into the CLI.** Custom-pack authors can validate
  schema and semantic problems before enabling a pack, with focused diagnostics
  for executable scopes and rule definitions. ([#289])
- **Release-grade performance certificates.** The absolute evaluator budget
  gate now binds results to the full source commit, verifies every timed wire
  decision, applies an explicit 95/95 tail-tolerance rule, and emits a
  self-contained failure certificate outside the measured checkout.
- **More complete integration management.** CLI and installer flows can inspect
  and unconfigure supported agent integrations explicitly, with stronger
  ownership checks and truthful dry-run/summary behavior across Unix and
  Windows.

### Fixed

- **Normal upgrades can consume aggregate checksums.** The POSIX installer now
  falls back from an adjacent `<archive>.sha256` file to `SHA256SUMS.txt` or
  `SHA256SUMS`, matching the PowerShell installer and repairing the tag-pinned
  updater path reported in [#342].
- **Official binaries have exact release provenance.** The release path now
  rejects dirty or ahead-of-tag binaries before signing, preventing the
  `LocalAheadOfRelease` false classification reported in [#344].
- **Every archive is signed by the DSR release authority.** The six platform
  archives publish adjacent `.minisig` files under the documented long-lived
  key, repairing the fail-closed installer path reported in [#351].
- **Pipeline diagnostics preserve the command users actually wrote.** Shell
  transformations no longer erase syntax needed for matching and explanations;
  unverifiable Python-to-PowerShell pipelines identify the producer that could
  not be modeled instead of presenting an opaque refusal.
- **Safer alternatives are operation-specific.** Suggestions now reflect the
  destructive operation's flags and target shape, and their classifier rules
  are checked for self-consistency.
- **Windows and hook protocol tests are host-independent.** Fixtures isolate
  ambient Git/configuration state, choose current-platform binary names, and
  reject stale Windows binaries instead of silently exercising old bytes.

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.13.0) -- 2026-08-24 [Release]

Minor bump: this release adds first-class support for a new agent host (Oh My Pi)
across detection, install, uninstall and doctor, and closes a config-override
bypass that could allow an unexamined command.

### Security

- **An `[overrides] allow` entry no longer speaks for the rest of a compound
  command.** Allow patterns are substring-matched, and the allow check runs
  *before* pack evaluation, so a single entry matching one segment returned
  `allowed` for text that was never examined — an entry naming a scratch path
  also allowed whatever followed the `&&`. A safe segment silencing a
  destructive one is the same bypass class `split_command_segments` already
  closes for pack patterns, so allow overrides now clear each segment on its
  own terms: a single-segment command keeps the previous whole-string
  semantics, and a compound command is allowed only when every segment is
  itself allowed. Anything uncovered falls through to normal evaluation.
  Command substitutions are segments too, so a safe outer command cannot
  carry a destructive inner one past the check.

  As a side effect, anchored entries now compose across a chain for the first
  time: `^a$` and `^b$` previously allowed neither half of `a && b`, because
  neither matched the whole string. ([#340])

### Added

- **First-class Oh My Pi (`omp`) agent support** in detection, CLI, and
  `dcg doctor`, with easy-mode installers and uninstallers taught about it and
  a symmetric uninstall path. The generated OMP extension bridge carries schema
  validation and health checks, monotonic child-transition handling, refined
  timeout and process-signal handling, and dynamic shell-dialect selection for
  eligible local PTYs. Agent coverage in the installer was expanded alongside
  it. ([#335])

### Fixed

- **`dcg doctor` no longer undercounts enabled packs.** It counted the raw
  enabled-pack set, which carries the bare `core` category marker, while
  `dcg packs --enabled` lists the two registry leaves that marker expands into
  (`core.filesystem`, `core.git`). The two numbers disagreed by exactly one in
  every configuration. Doctor now counts registry leaf packs, so both agree.
  No protection was missing; only the reported count was wrong. ([#335])
- **A block message no longer grows with the command it is reporting on.** The
  message becomes the hook's `permissionDecisionReason`, which lands in an
  agent's context and is replayed on every later turn, and it embedded the
  command verbatim: a 10 KB heredoc write produced a ~10.8 KB reason and a
  50 KB one produced ~50.8 KB, while the stderr box stayed a constant ~2 KB.
  The echoed command is now capped and the reason reports how many bytes were
  elided, which is the useful signal. Ordinary commands are untouched and stay
  copy-pasteable. ([#339])
- **OMP hardening:** invalid profile environments are rejected, commands are
  evaluated in the effective cwd, agent policy is applied in robot mode, the
  installer conflict summary is preserved, project extensions are anchored to
  cwd, and `PI_CONFIG_DIR` is honored when detecting OMP. PowerShell installer
  and uninstaller handle Windows OMP config paths correctly.
- **Install path:** the OpenCode plugin and OMP extension are written
  atomically, a non-UTF-8 `dcg` path is refused rather than embedded in
  generated JavaScript, and the native-integration install flags are mutually
  exclusive.
- **E2E harness:** the matrix no longer swallows failures inside `&&` / `||`
  chains.

## [v0.12.5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.5) -- 2026-08-23 [Release]

### Security

- **Shell long options no longer hide a piped or process-substituted
  payload.** A shell consumer carrying an unrecognized no-value long option
  (`bash --norc`, `--posix`, `--login`, `--noprofile`, and `sh` equivalents)
  was read as if the option were a script-file operand, so
  `echo 'rm -rf ~' | bash --norc` and `bash --norc <(echo 'rm -rf ~')` were
  **allowed**. The shell still reads its program from stdin / the substitution,
  so the payload is now scanned. Value-taking (`--rcfile`, `--init-file`) and
  terminal (`--`, `--help`, `--version`, `--command`) long options are
  classified precisely.
- **`--rcfile` / `--init-file` process substitutions are treated as executing
  sinks.** An interactive shell sources its init file at startup, and that file
  may be a process substitution: `bash --init-file <(…) -i` runs the
  substitution's output (verified on macOS and Linux). The marker was swallowed
  as an inert option value, allowing the payload; it is now evaluated as the
  shell's source. `-o` / `-O` still consume their set-option/shopt name (which
  bash rejects rather than executes).

### Fixed

- **Rebase-recovery no longer unlocks a `git` command against the wrong
  repository.** The recovery-mode `cwd` resolver now fails closed when a `cd`
  cannot reach the `git` segment through a subshell separator
  (`cd repo & git restore`, `cd repo | git restore`), when git-repo-redirecting
  environment assignments (`GIT_DIR=`, `GIT_WORK_TREE=`, …) re-point git, and
  on `pushd -n` / bare `pushd`, which do not change the working directory the
  way the walk assumed.
- **Denials name the allow-once remedy.** The `permissionDecisionReason` now
  states the scoped `dcg allow-once <code>` command for harnesses that surface
  only the reason string, and the operator banner lists it above
  `dcg allowlist add` (GH #332).

### Added

- **New `database.databricks` pack.** Guards destructive Databricks CLI
  operations (executable-scoped), included in the `careful_company` preset
  (GH #333).

## [v0.12.4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.4) -- 2026-08-23 [Release]

### Security

- **Quoted `rm` flags no longer bypass the always-on `rm -rf` guard
  (bd-5xgt).** bash concatenates adjacent quoted/unquoted characters, so
  `rm -r'f' /` (and `rm -'r'f /`, `rm -r"f" /`, `rm '-r'f /`) really runs
  `rm -rf /` — but dcg **allowed** them, because the `rm` flag char-class
  matching saw the literal quote and stopped. This defeated dcg's flagship
  protection cross-platform via trivial quote insertion. `rm` option-position
  tokens are now dequoted (balanced single/double quotes and backslash
  escapes) before flag parsing; since option tokens are always executed
  syntax rather than data, this cannot turn a quoted-data mention into a
  false positive. `core.git` was unaffected; quoted data arguments
  (`echo 'rm -rf /'`, `grep 'rm -rf' file`) stay allowed; an unbalanced quote
  is a shell syntax error that never runs `rm` and stays allowed. Found via
  the `fuzz_normalize` idempotence invariant, then confirmed against real
  bash argv. Regression corpus: `tests/corpus/bypass_attempts/quoted_flags.toml`.
- The `fuzz_normalize` harness length invariant was corrected: normalization
  *canonicalizes* (it inserts a separator when a redirect operator is glued to
  the preceding token) and can grow by a bounded amount, so the check now
  guards against pathological growth while keeping the load-bearing idempotence
  assertion.

---

## [v0.12.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.3) -- 2026-08-22 [Release]

### Security

- **Bare `cmd`/`pwsh` reading piped or redirected stdin as commands is now
  guarded on the cmd/PowerShell dialects (bd-1o5h).** A shell consuming piped
  source runs its program from stdin, but the executing-sink pipeline analysis
  was bash-AST/POSIX-only, so `echo del /s /q C:\x | cmd`, `echo "Remove-Item …"
  | pwsh`, `type payload.txt | cmd`, and the `cmd < payload.bat` /
  `pwsh < script.ps1` redirect forms ran the payload unguarded — while
  `cmd /c "…"`, `powershell -`, and the whole POSIX `| bash` side already
  denied. A native cmd/PowerShell pipeline collector now reuses the existing
  `cmd_pipeline_input_mode` / `powershell_pipeline_input_mode` consumer helpers:
  a statically-known producer piped into a bare stdin-reading shell is
  evaluated as that shell's source, and a `<`-redirected file into such a shell
  fails closed. Only a bare stdin-reading shell consumer triggers a sink, so
  ordinary pipelines (`| findstr`, `| Where-Object`, `| Out-File`, `| clip`,
  `cmd /c …`, `pwsh -File …`) are untouched. Found in the v0.12.2 adversarial
  sweep; regression suite `tests/repro_1o5h_cmd_pwsh_stdin_consumer.rs`.

---

## [v0.12.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.2) -- 2026-08-22 [Release]

### Security

- **A redirect or stdin device on a piped/substituted shell defeated the
  executable-source analysis.** Found in an adversarial sweep of the v0.12.1
  heredoc-pipeline fix. A shell consuming piped or process-substituted source
  reads its program from stdin (or the substitution file), but a redirection
  operator on that consumer was mistaken for a script-file operand and
  flipped the verdict to "the shell runs nothing", allowing the payload:
  - `… | bash 2>/dev/null` / `… | bash >log 2>&1` — an output redirect on the
    piped shell;
  - `… | bash /dev/stdin` / `bash /dev/fd/0` — the shell reads the pipe as a
    file through the stdin device;
  - `bash 2>/dev/null <(echo …)` — the same on a process-substitution
    consumer (bash and interpreter forms).
  Redirection operators are now classified (`classify_shell_positional`) and
  skipped when scanning a consumer's arguments; stdin-device operands are
  recognized as reading the pipe, and a genuine stdin *reassignment*
  (`bash < file`) fails closed. Legit pipelines whose consumer runs a real
  script file (`… | bash deploy.sh`) or a data tool (`… | grep`, `… | wc`)
  are unchanged. Regression suite:
  `tests/repro_heredoc_pipeline_producer_bypass.rs`.

---

## [v0.12.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.1) -- 2026-08-22 [Release]

### Security

- **A heredoc piped into a shell or interpreter bypassed every rule
  (shipped in v0.11.0 – v0.12.0).** `cat <<'EOF' | bash … EOF` (also `| sh`,
  `| bash -s`, `| python3`, `| sudo bash`, `| env bash`) executed its body
  unguarded: tree-sitter-bash attaches the pipeline of a heredoc-carrying
  statement to the `heredoc_redirect` node, so the `pipeline` node begins
  with the `|` operator and has no producer stage, and the executable-sink
  collector — which only inspected consumers at index ≥ 1 of a pipeline's
  stages — never saw the consumer at all, while the data-sink masking
  treated the `cat` heredoc as inert prose. The producer is now synthesized
  from the enclosing statement and the body is evaluated as the consumer's
  source exactly like `echo … | bash`; a heredoc fed to a shell through a
  non-`cat` producer (`tee x <<EOF | bash`, `sed … <<EOF | bash`) fails
  closed as `heredoc.posix:pipeline-consumer`. Data consumers are
  untouched (`cat <<'EOF' | grep -c rm`, `| wc -l`, `| tee notes.md`).
  Regression suite: `tests/repro_heredoc_pipeline_producer_bypass.rs`.
- **`dcg hook` batched envelopes resolve every entry before one speaks.**
  Follow-up to the #330 fix: the VS Code Agent Host `toolCalls[]` loop
  stopped at the first evaluator-level non-allow entry, which `[policy]`
  could now turn into a `warn`/`log` allow — so a destructive entry later in
  the same batch was never evaluated. Every entry is now resolved (verdict
  and policy mode) and the highest-ranked one speaks for the line:
  deny > indeterminate > ask > warn > log > allow. This mirrors the
  resolve-all-then-rank flow bare `dcg` already used.
- **Rebase recovery re-checks the rest of the line (see Fixed, #331).**
  `git restore -- f; git reset --hard` and cross-repository
  `cd <rebasing> && git restore -- f && cd <other> && git restore -- g` were
  allowed outright during an in-progress rebase on v0.12.0.

### Fixed

- **`dcg hook` now honours `[policy]` mode overrides (#330).** The JSONL
  subcommand evaluated commands without resolving the active policy, so a
  rule downgraded to `warn` or `log` via `[policy] default_mode`,
  `[policy.packs]`, or `[policy.rules]` still produced `{"decision":"deny"}`
  — while `dcg test` reported `WARN (policy allows)` for the same config.
  `dcg hook` now runs the same resolver as bare `dcg` and `dcg test`:
  `warn`/`log` matches report `"decision":"allow"` (warn also announces the
  relaxed rule on stderr), `ask` stays `deny` because the protocol has no
  review channel, and a new additive `"mode"` field names the resolved mode
  on every matched line. Explicit `[overrides].block` entries, the
  critical-severity floor on broad policies, and severity-default modes
  (`git stash drop` warns by default) behave identically in both entry
  points, pinned by a parity suite.
- **Rebase recovery probes the repository the command actually reaches
  (#331).** The auto-allow for an in-progress rebase and the
  `dcg rebase-recover` permit were resolved against the hook's cwd, so the
  common `cd <worktree> && git restore --ours -- f` phrasing was denied (and
  a freshly minted permit left unconsumed) exactly when the documented
  recovery flow was being followed. The probe now starts from the
  harness-reported `cwd` (falling back to the hook process cwd) and follows
  a leading static `cd` / `pushd` and a `git -C <literal>` on the guarded
  segment. Anything dcg cannot attribute statically — expansions,
  subshells, `cd -`, `popd`, `--git-dir`/`--work-tree`, a directory that
  does not exist — keeps the deny.
- **A recovery signal unlocks the recovery rules, never the whole line.**
  Found while reviewing #331: the first recovery-eligible match converted
  the deny into an allow without re-checking the rest of the command, so
  `git restore -- f; git reset --hard` ran unguarded inside a rebasing repo,
  and a second `git restore` after a further `cd` ran in a repository the
  probe never looked at. The command is now re-evaluated with exactly the
  four recovery rules granted; any other finding keeps its own verdict, the
  permit is spent only when the line actually runs, and a trailing command
  that could move the shell (a script, `bash -c`, `eval`, `xargs`, …)
  closes the window for that line. The block text now says the retry must
  be the recovery command on its own line (a leading `cd <repo> &&` is
  fine).
- **Windows binaries carry a VERSIONINFO resource and application manifest
  (#303).** `dcg.exe` shipped unsigned, stripped, size-optimized, and with
  no version resource at all — close to a worst-case input for Defender's
  `!ml` heuristics (`Trojan:Win32/Bearfoos.B!ml`) and anonymous in Explorer
  and AV submissions. `build.rs` now embeds product/company/description/
  version metadata and an `asInvoker` manifest (long-path and UTF-8 aware)
  on Windows targets; a missing resource compiler degrades to a cargo
  warning, never a failed build. Metadata only — no code path changes.
  Authenticode signing remains the durable fix and is tracked separately.

### Changed

- The prose-through-a-data-sink posture from #329 is pinned by tests:
  `cat > notes.md <<'EOF' … EOF` bodies are data in every spelling, executing
  sinks (`bash <<EOF`, `… | bash`) still block, and inline interpreter
  literals (`python3 -c "print(\"rm -rf\")"`) deliberately stay on the
  conservative raw-shell scan (#136 / #278). No behavior change: the
  reported block (against 0.11.1) does not reproduce on current `main`.

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.12.0) -- 2026-08-20 [Release]

### Added

- **`ssh <host> '<command>'` remote payloads are scanned (#326).** ssh
  concatenates every argv word after the destination and hands the result to
  the remote login shell — an inline-shell wrapper exactly like `sh -c`, minus
  the flag. dcg treated the quoted payload as opaque argv data, so
  `ssh host 'dropdb mydb'` rode through while the unquoted spelling was
  denied — a false negative in precisely the remote-execution direction. The
  heredoc pipeline now extracts the payload (walking the modeled OpenSSH
  option grammar to locate the destination: bundled flags, attached values
  like `-p2222`, separate values like `-o X=y`, and `--`) and recursively
  evaluates it, so quoted and unquoted spellings reach the same decision and
  every enabled pack applies to the remote command. Read-only remote
  diagnostics (`uptime`, `df -h`, `journalctl …`) stay allowed, the payload's
  own quoting still classifies remote data as data
  (`ssh h 'echo "dropdb mydb"'` passes), `echo`/`grep`/commit-message
  mentions of ssh stay inert, and an unmodeled ssh option makes extraction
  bail to the previous behavior rather than guess at the destination (a real
  ssh refuses unknown options anyway). The opt-in `remote.ssh` pack is
  unchanged and still adds its curated remote-execution rules on top.

### Fixed

- **The dead `overrides.allowlist` / `overrides.allowlist_rules` config keys
  are removed and loudly reported (#327).** Both keys parsed, appeared in
  `dcg config schema` with worked examples, and were never consulted: the
  config layer merge only carried `overrides.allow`/`block`, so the
  documented path-scoped allowlisting silently had no effect (and the dead
  compile path behind it ignored `paths` anyway — wiring it up as parsed
  would have granted path-scoped configs *global* allowances). The keys are
  gone from the schema (`config.schema.json` regenerated); a config still
  carrying them parses, grants nothing, and is now named explicitly by
  `dcg config` (a `Warnings:` section), `dcg config --format json` (a
  `warnings` array plus `overrides.removed_keys_present`), and `dcg doctor`'s
  configuration check, each pointing at the surfaces that work:
  `overrides.allow`, per-rule `exempt_target_globs`, and `dcg allowlist add`.
  Closing the report's observability gap, `dcg config --format json` now also
  echoes the enforcement-relevant `overrides`, `rules`, and `policy` sections
  (deterministically ordered), so CI can assert what is actually loaded
  instead of inferring it from `dcg test` decisions.

- **`redirect-truncate-root-home` no longer recommends an alternative it then
  denies (#316 follow-up).** The rule's "Make a backup" suggestion —
  `cp <file> <file>.bak && echo data > <file>` — still ends in a truncating
  redirect onto the same home/system path, so an agent that instantiated it
  from the triggering command was denied again by the same rule. The
  suggestion (block-message prose and the structured `PatternSuggestion`) now
  routes the write through a temp file: `cp <file> <file>.bak &&
  echo data > /tmp/<subdir>/out && cp -f /tmp/<subdir>/out <file>`, which the
  hook allows end-to-end even for home targets. Two sibling rows with the
  same latent trap were fixed in the same pass: the `truncate` rules'
  "keep the first N bytes" suggestion (`head -c N <file> > <file>.head` —
  a home-path redirect) now writes the head through `/tmp` and `cp -f`s it
  into place, and `mv-sensitive-source-root-home`'s in-place-rename
  suggestion (`mv <file> <file>.deleted-YYYYMMDD` — itself an mv touching a
  sensitive path) is now marked gated, so it renders with the explicit
  "dcg gates this too — it needs explicit approval" marker
  (`mv-dynamic-path` got its own suggestion set where the literal rename
  stays ungated, since a resolved literal rename is exactly the escape from
  that denial). The #316 suggestion self-consistency sweep now instantiates
  `{path}` with a home path (in addition to the relative path) for every rule
  whose name carries `root-home`/`sensitive` — the configuration the original
  sweep never exercised, which is why this row survived it — and requires
  gated suggestions to be denied in at least one applicable profile.

## [v0.11.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.11.1) -- 2026-08-19 [Release]

### Added

- **First-party OpenCode support (#318).** `dcg install --opencode` writes a
  native `tool.execute.before` plugin to
  `~/.config/opencode/plugins/dcg-guard.js` (`--project` for
  `<repo>/.opencode/plugins/`). The plugin routes every OpenCode `bash` tool
  call through dcg's Claude-compatible hook protocol — spawning the absolute
  dcg path embedded at install time with `OPENCODE=1` so the agent is
  identified — and aborts the tool call by throwing on a `deny` (an `ask`
  verdict also fails closed; OpenCode has no operator-review state).
  Infrastructure failures (dcg missing) fail open with a stderr notice. The
  file carries a `dcg-opencode-plugin` ownership marker: the installer refuses
  to overwrite a user-owned file of that name even with `--force`, and
  `uninstall.sh` deletes only marker-carrying files. `install.sh` configures
  OpenCode automatically when detected, `dcg doctor` gains an
  `opencode_plugin` check (an error + `--fix`able when OpenCode is in use but
  unguarded — there is no Claude-compat fallback), and `Agent::OpenCode` is
  detected from the plugin's `OPENCODE=1`. New
  `docs/opencode-integration.md`. Motivated by a real shared-environment
  outage where a green doctor coexisted with an entirely unguarded OpenCode
  install.
- **`dcg update` can no longer silently replace a local build that is ahead of
  its release (#320).** Build provenance (`git describe --tags --dirty`, plus
  an explicit `DCG_RELEASE_BUILD=1` marker exported by dist.yml and the DSR
  runbook) is embedded at compile time and shown as a `Commit:` line in
  `dcg --version`. `dcg update` now refuses — before any network or installer
  work — when the installed binary is a local build ahead of its release tag,
  or when the install is pinned via the new `general.update_pin` config
  (`DCG_UPDATE_PIN` env). The explicit escape hatch is
  `dcg update --replace-local-build`. Pinned installs also suppress the
  background "update available" nudge, and a new warning-only doctor check
  (`build_provenance`) flags the unpinned-local-ahead state that is one
  routine update away from silent coverage loss.
- **Suggestions dcg itself gates are now labeled, machine-checked, and
  consistent (#316).** `PatternSuggestion` gained a `gated` flag: a gated
  suggestion is a *less* destructive form of the blocked operation that still
  requires approval, and every renderer now says so explicitly ("dcg gates
  this too — it needs explicit approval" in block output, `[gated: ...]` in
  `dcg packs`/classify text, a `gated` field in JSON) so an agent reading the
  block message stops retrying suggestions dcg will deny. The 14 remaining
  self-denied suggestions from the #316 sweep are either fixed or marked
  gated: the MySQL `TRUNCATE`⇄`DELETE` mutual-referral loop is broken (backup
  suggestion first, gated cross-references labeled), the kamal proxy rules
  gained `kamal proxy restart` as a runnable first alternative,
  `core.git:branch-dynamic-token` now leads with the workflow fix that
  actually works and clarifies that quoting protects a *creation* while a
  literal `-D` stays gated, and the docker/kubectl/postgres/bigquery/
  guardrails/github rows carry accurate gated markers. Two registry-wide
  tests enforce the invariant in both directions (every non-gated suggestion
  is allowed by its own pack; every gated marker is real), replacing the
  first-suggestion-only check. External YAML packs can declare
  `gated: true` per suggestion.
- **The fail-closed launcher-verifier family now carries stable, allowlistable
  rule ids (#316, #304, #313).** "Embedded shell launcher cannot be statically
  verified" and "Inline interpreter launcher cannot be statically verified"
  denials previously reported `"rule_id": null` with `source:
  "legacy_pattern"` — nothing to `dcg allowlist add`, nothing for
  `[policy.rules]`. They are now `heredoc.shell:launcher-unverified` and
  `heredoc.posix:inline-launcher-unverified`: reviewable, allowlistable
  (an allowlist grant skips only the fail-closed launcher check — the rest of
  the command is still evaluated on its own merits), and policy-addressable
  like the #261 family.

### Fixed

- **Heredoc/launcher allowlist grants no longer override pack denials.** A
  grant for a fail-closed heredoc-family rule (e.g.
  `heredoc.shell:launcher-unverified`) was converted into a whole-command
  allow at the end of evaluation even when the pack pass had denied the
  command — an unverifiable encoded-launcher segment chained with `rm -rf /`
  was allowed in full under the grant. Both terminal conversion sites now
  attribute the grant only to an ALLOW outcome; pack denials and indeterminate
  verdicts pass through untouched, so a grant skips exactly the fail-closed
  check it names and nothing else (bd-l9jf whole-command leg).
- **Windows installer repairs a stale `$PROFILE` hook-check (#282).** The
  earlier #282 fix corrected the startup-check block's detection text, but the
  installer skipped any profile already containing the marker line — which was
  identical across versions — so pre-fix installs kept warning
  `[dcg] Hook missing from ~/.claude/settings.json` on every new terminal no
  matter how often dcg was reinstalled or updated. `Add-DcgProfileCheck` now
  rewrites the managed block in place when its content is stale (line-ending
  differences don't count as stale), and best-effort repairs the *other*
  PowerShell host's `profile.ps1` (Windows PowerShell 5.1 vs pwsh 7) without
  ever creating one.
- **Unix shell startup checks self-repair too.** `install.sh` and
  `dcg setup --shell-check` had the same marker-only idempotence trap on the
  bash/zsh RC snippet: once the marker line existed, no re-run would ever
  replace the block, pinning users to the first snippet version they received.
  The Unix snippet has never changed, so nobody was bitten — this closes the
  trap before the first time it does. Both injectors now rewrite a stale
  managed region (marker line through the first column-0 `fi`) in place; an
  unrecognizable boundary falls back to appending a current block.
- **The keyword pre-filter treats `_` as a boundary, not a word character
  (#323).** Underscore was in the pre-filter's word class, so underscore-joined
  names never admitted a pack: `export DCG_DISABLE=1` quick-rejected past the
  guardrails pack's own self-weakening rule, `terraform destroy
  -target=cloudflare_record.www` past `dns.cloudflare`, and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` /
  `SCW_SECRET_KEY` past every credential rule — the regexes were correct but
  never ran (silent fail-open, invisible to tests written against hyphenated
  decoys). `_` is now a boundary in the pre-filter only; pack regexes still
  decide the verdict, so the change can only admit more commands to full
  evaluation. Alphanumeric continuations (`dcgx`) still quick-reject.
- **Dead-gated rules re-armed by fixing their packs' keyword lists (#323).**
  `system.disk` gained `umount` (the `umount-force` rule was unreachable — no
  keyword in the list occurs in `umount -f`), `database.redis` gained `valkey`
  and `keydb` (the protocol-compatible client renames; every rule silently
  stopped firing on those binaries), and `database.mysql` gained `mariadb` and
  `RESET MASTER` (the renamed client, and the reset-master statement when it
  reaches the shell without a `mysql` token).
- **A `Bash`-labeled command that is unmistakably PowerShell now evaluates as
  the fail-closed union of all dialects (#322).** VS Code Agent Host
  transforms PowerShell tool calls and puts `tool_name: "Bash"` on the wire,
  so `Remove-Item -LiteralPath .\pipelines -Recurse -Force` was evaluated
  under the POSIX dialect — where a cmdlet is an inert unknown binary — and
  executed. When any statement segment starts with an approved-verb
  `Verb-Noun` cmdlet token, the hook now widens the dialect to `Unknown`,
  which fails closed across every dialect. Explicit `powershell`/`pwsh`/`cmd`
  labels are never second-guessed, and hyphenated POSIX commands (`apt-get`,
  `docker-compose`, `start-stop-daemon`) do not widen.
  **Two follow-up gaps closed (fresh-eyes review):** (1) the widening only
  fired on `Verb-Noun` cmdlet tokens, so the PowerShell/cmd *aliases* agents
  emit most — `rm -Recurse -Force .\pipelines`, `del /s /q C:\src`,
  `rd /s C:\dir` — still evaluated as POSIX and failed open. The hook now also
  widens when a segment leads with a destructive alias (`rm`/`ri`/`del`/`rd`/
  `rmdir`/`erase`) **and** carries a Windows-shell-only argument — a
  single-dash PowerShell parameter word (`-Recurse`/`-Force`/`-Path`/…, a
  ≥3-char prefix that POSIX `rm` never accepts) or a cmd switch (`/s`, `/q`).
  A plain POSIX `rm -rf ./build` has neither and keeps the Posix dialect.
  (2) The oversized-input fail-closed path (`try_deny_oversized_input`, taken
  when a payload exceeds `max_command_bytes`) resolved each scan window with an
  *unrefined* dialect, so padding a mislabeled PowerShell payload past the
  limit reopened the same hole. That path now applies the identical
  `refine_shell_dialect` widening per window.
- **`redirect-truncate-root-home` knows the macOS home spelling (#325).**
  The sensitive-path alternation carried `/home` but not `/Users`, so `echo x
  > /Users/<user>/.zshrc` — the absolute form tools actually hand agents —
  was allowed while `> ~/.zshrc`, `> $HOME/.zshrc`, and even the *less*
  certain `> $D/.zshrc` were blocked. `/Users` now sits in the shared
  alternation of every rule that uses it (`redirect-truncate-root-home`,
  `mv-sensitive-source-root-home`, `find -delete`, `unlink`, `truncate`,
  `shred`, `tar --remove-files`, `dd of=`, and the cp/ln/rsync
  copy-then-delete chains), matching the platform parity the `rm` rules
  already had (#247).
- **Write-safe character devices no longer deny as truncating redirects
  (#324).** `> /dev/null`, `> /dev/zero`, `> /dev/full`, and `> /dev/tty`
  are carved out of `redirect-truncate-*`: these are always character
  devices, so opening them with `O_TRUNC` cannot destroy persistent data,
  and each false block cost a human round-trip. `/dev/st0` (tape) and
  `/dev/tty0`/`/dev/ttysNNN` (other terminals) stay blocked.
  **Correction (fresh-eyes review):** the carve-out originally also covered
  `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`, and `/dev/fd/[0-2]`, on the false premise that
  they too are character devices. They are symlinks to whatever fd 0/1/2
  currently point at, which may be a regular file (after `exec > logfile` or
  an inherited redirect) — where `O_TRUNC` truncates that real file. Those
  three are no longer carved out; the guard blocks them under its
  zero-false-negatives posture.

- **Quoted `>` bytes inside an inline interpreter payload no longer read as
  redirect syntax when the segment carries a real redirect (#317).** `sh -c
  "echo 'a => %s'" 2>&1` (and the `2>/dev/null` / literal `/tmp` target /
  `python3 -c` / `node -e` variants) allowed: the `redirect-truncate-*` match
  offset is now re-derived against the payload's own quoting, extending the
  6f1aa5a treatment from `$`/backtick to the redirect operator. A live `>`
  inside the payload (`bash -c "cat x > $T"`), a dynamic or sensitive target
  outside it, and multi-segment payloads all keep the fail-closed deny.
- **PowerShell `2>$null` is the null device, not a dynamic path (#321).**
  Under a proven PowerShell dialect, a command whose every redirect target is
  the read-only `$null` automatic variable (case-insensitive, `${null}`
  included) no longer denies as `redirect-truncate-dynamic-path`. `$nullFile`,
  `$none`, mixed targets, and POSIX/Unknown dialects — where `null` is an
  ordinary assignable variable — stay denied.
- **Grok Build's documented shell tool name is accepted (#319).** Grok's hooks
  guide names the shell tool `run_terminal_command`; dcg only accepted the
  abbreviated `run_terminal_cmd`, so the documented envelope was answered with
  a "skip" — a silent fail-open on the exact path Grok uses. Both spellings now
  classify as the Grok protocol and evaluate the command.
- **`redirect-truncate-*` denials now carry redirect-specific suggestions
  (#316/#317).** The suggestion registry previously served the recursive-rm
  set (`ls -la` preview / `rm -ri` / move-to-trash) for redirect rules — a non
  sequitur on a redirect denial. The rules now suggest inspecting the resolved
  target, appending instead of truncating, redirecting to a literal temp path,
  and backing up first. The `rm-rf-root-home` explanation also no longer
  recommends `rm -rf /path/to/specific/directory` — a command dcg itself
  denies — and points at the literal-temp and interactive (`rm -ri`) forms it
  actually allows (#316).

### Dependencies

- Applied dependabot #315 directly: `async-trait` 0.1.92, `ast-grep-core` /
  `ast-grep-language` 0.45.1, `rusqlite` 0.40.2 (+ `libsqlite3-sys` 0.38.2).

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.11.0) -- 2026-08-14 [Release]

### Added

- **macOS `diskutil` coverage in `system.disk` (#305).** `diskutil eraseDisk`,
  `eraseVolume`, `reformat`, `zeroDisk`, `randomDisk`, and `secureErase` deny
  as `diskutil-erase`; `partitionDisk`, `splitPartition`, `mergePartitions`,
  and `resetFusion` as `diskutil-partition`; and `apfs
  deleteContainer/deleteVolume/eraseVolume/deleteSnapshot` as
  `diskutil-apfs-delete` — all Critical, all case-insensitive because diskutil
  accepts any verb casing. Read-only verbs (`list`, `info`, `activity`,
  `apfs list`/`listSnapshots`) stay allowed, and a read-only verb cannot mask
  a chained destructive verb on the same line.
- **The canonical fork bomb is blocked (#302).** `:(){ :|:& };:` and
  word-named variants deny as `core.filesystem:fork-bomb` (Critical). The
  regex uses backreferences to require the same identifier in all three
  positions, so ordinary function definitions that pipe two *different*
  commands do not match. Because the shape necessarily spans `|`, `&`, and
  `;`, the rule joins the whole-command cross-segment pass, and the shell
  function-definition operator `()` (pure syntax, invisible to span-based
  keyword gating) is now a recognized quick-reject signal for the pack.
  Differently shaped bombs (`while true; do (x) & done`) remain out of scope —
  the regex family cannot enforce those without unbounded false positives.
- **Proven timestamped sibling-backup `mv` is allowed (#308).** The exact
  cross-harness installer shape — `STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S);
  BACKUP="<src>.backup-$STAMP"; mv "<src>" "$BACKUP"` — is a reversible
  sibling rename: the destination is proven to be the source plus a
  digits-only suffix, and the two assignments must be the segments
  immediately before the `mv` so nothing can mutate them in between. Only
  `mv-dynamic-path` and `mv-sensitive-source-root-home` are narrowed; any
  deviation (a different substitution, non-sibling destination, mv options,
  extra operands, an intervening segment, traversal, globs, unquoted
  destination) keeps the fail-closed deny.


- **`database.bigquery` pack — the `bq` CLI and GoogleSQL.** 11 CLI rules and
  21 GoogleSQL rules. Three BigQuery specifics drive them, and each one makes a
  naive port of the PostgreSQL/Snowflake packs wrong: a *dataset* is a `SCHEMA`
  in GoogleSQL, so `DROP SCHEMA` is the dataset-level catastrophe rather than a
  namespace tidy-up (Critical); GoogleSQL **requires** a `WHERE` clause on
  `DELETE`/`UPDATE`, so `WHERE TRUE` is the idiomatic full-table spelling and a
  `delete-without-where` rule modelled on PostgreSQL would never fire; and time
  travel (2–7 days) is the only undo, so `--max_time_travel_hours` and
  `SET OPTIONS(expiration_timestamp)` destroy the recovery path itself and are
  destructive in their own right. BigQuery ML models get their own rule —
  they are not covered by time travel and cost hours of training to rebuild.
  CLI rules are scoped with `executables = ["bq"]` *and* a `bq`-anchored regex,
  because `executables` is enforced in the evaluator rather than in
  `Pack::check`. Opt-in like every other `database.*` pack; joins the
  `careful_company_running_windows` preset; recommended automatically when a
  project depends on `google-cloud-bigquery`, `@google-cloud/bigquery`,
  `pandas-gbq`, or `sqlalchemy-bigquery`.

  Evaluator wiring makes the pack *indirect*, so its unscoped GoogleSQL rules
  cannot claim the SQL inside another client's invocation: `database.bigquery`
  sorts first within tier 7, so without it `snow sql -q "DROP TABLE ..."` would
  have been reported as a BigQuery rule. Regression cases pin both directions.

  Implemented independently from the analysis in closed PR #295, per the
  project's no-outside-merges policy.

- **`dcg doctor --strict` (#296).** `doctor` exited `0` unconditionally, including
  when it had just reported `"ok": false` — so `dcg doctor || handle_failure` was
  dead code and a provisioning run got a green signal from a guard doctor itself
  had classified as broken. `--strict` makes the exit status carry the verdict.
  It is opt-in, matching `pack validate --strict`; the default stays `0` for
  anyone already calling doctor in a pipeline.

### Changed

- **The block message no longer echoes the command twice (#299).** The command
  appeared in both the `Tip: dcg explain "<cmd>"` line and a `Command: <cmd>`
  line, making `len(permissionDecisionReason) = 2*len(command) + 499` exactly. A
  hook decision lands in the agent's transcript and is replayed on every later
  turn, so the second echo was paid for repeatedly while telling the reader
  nothing the first did not — the agent just wrote that command. The `Tip:` copy
  is kept because it is also actionable. No verdict changes.
- **`platform.github` rules now carry explanations and suggestions (#300).** All
  sixteen destructive rules were built with the 3-arg macro form, so every
  denial rendered as "No additional explanation is available yet. See pack
  documentation for details." Each rule now explains what is actually lost and
  names the safer spelling — for the raw-API catch-all, that includes pointing at
  the first-class `gh issue edit --remove-parent` / `--remove-sub-issue` verbs,
  which dcg allows outright. A new pack test enforces this going forward.

### Fixed

- **`chown -R`/`chmod -R`/`setfacl -R` on bare `/` and `/home` now deny
  (#301).** Two independent bugs in `system.permissions`: the protected-path
  regex tail `(?:$|bin|...)\b` could never match a bare `/` (the `\b` after
  the end-anchor has no word character to bound), and `/home` was missing
  from the protected list entirely. `chmod-777` had masked the 777 case,
  which is why the gap survived the obvious test. `/home` is scoped to the
  home root or a whole single-user home (`/home`, `/home/user` — where
  `~/.ssh` lives), so a routine `chmod -R /home/user/project` on a project
  directory stays allowed while `chmod -R /home` (which locks out every
  account) is blocked.
- **`pnpm`/`npm`/`yarn` publish rules require subcommand position (#306).**
  `pnpm run build; bun ./publish-snapshot.ts`, `pnpm run build --reporter
  "publish"`, and `pnpm run build publish` no longer deny: `publish` must be
  reachable through option tokens only, so argument data and later shell
  segments are not publication. Because the pack regexes run on the sanitized
  command — which has already stripped the quotes that distinguish
  `pnpm --reporter "publish"` (a value) from `pnpm --reporter publish` — a
  match is confirmed against the **original** command by a quoting-aware gate
  (`invokes_publish_subcommand`): an unquoted `publish` in subcommand position
  is publication, a quoted one is data. Real forms (`pnpm -r publish`,
  `pnpm recursive publish`, `--filter <ws> publish`, `yarn workspace <ws>
  publish`, `yarn npm publish`, `pnpm.cmd`) still deny, and an unquoted
  option value named `publish` stays fail-closed, in every dialect. The
  `*-dry-run` safe patterns are segment-bounded so a dry-run in one segment
  cannot mask a later one.
- **Single-quoted `$`/backtick/backslash in `mv` paths are literal (#307).**
  `mv './$ROOT' /tmp/x` is data, not expansion: `mv-dynamic-path` stands
  down only when *every* dynamic marker in the command is inside a POSIX
  single-quoted span. One active marker anywhere — double quotes, unquoted
  variables, a quote-manipulating backslash — keeps the deny.
- **`dcg --robot test` honors the hook evaluation budget (#309).** Robot mode
  is an agent-integration boundary, so it now enforces the configured
  timeout and answers with bounded `{"decision":"indeterminate",
  "source":"analysis_budget"}` JSON without requiring the human-facing
  `--enforce-budget` diagnostic flag (which stays opt-in for interactive
  `dcg test`).
- **`pwsh --version`/`--help` and read-only `-c` variable expressions are
  allowed (#304).** pwsh accepts exactly two GNU-style spellings, both
  print-and-exit; they no longer land in the unknown-host-option refusal.
  And a `-Command` payload that is exactly one variable read with property
  accesses (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`, `$env:PATH`) invokes nothing, so it
  no longer trips the runtime-expansion refusal — invoking, indexing,
  subexpressions, or any second statement stays fail-closed. (`-File` was
  already fixed on main; `SP=…; pwsh -c "…"` likewise.)
- **Backing up the agent's hook config is a read, not tampering (#313).**
  `Copy-Item ~/.claude/settings.json <backup>` no longer denies:
  copy-family verbs moved out of `agent-hook-config-tamper` into a new
  `agent-hook-config-overwrite` rule that fires only when the config path is
  the *write* side (`-Destination` or positional destination). Deleting,
  rewriting, moving, or renaming the live config still denies, as does
  copying anything onto it.
- **`bash -c` payloads keep their own quote context (#288 follow-up).**
  `bash -lc 'grep -n "rm -rf /" notes.md'` was denied while the bare inner
  command was correctly allowed: the match landed inside the inline payload,
  whose `InlineCode` classification dropped the payload's internal quoting.
  A core-rule match inside a POSIX-shell inline payload is now re-classified
  against the payload itself, so it resolves exactly like the bare inner
  command — and `bash -c 'rm -rf /'` still denies, because the payload
  classifies it as live code.


- **A pathological `gh` command line could fail OPEN.** The shared option-prefix
  in `platform.github` used `\S+` for an option's value, which also matches a
  flag token — so in `gh -a -b -c …` each token could parse either as a new
  option or as the previous one's value, giving exponentially many parses.
  These patterns carry a lookahead and therefore run on the backtracking
  engine, where `CompiledRegex::is_match` maps a backtrack-limit error to
  `false`. Adopted the unambiguous shape the database packs already use
  (`[^-\s;&|][^\s;&|]*`).
- **`dcg doctor`'s pretty renderer computed a wrong verdict**, which now
  matters because `--strict` derives the exit status from it — and pretty is
  what runs in CI, since rich output is disabled without a TTY. A failed
  config write printed an error without counting it, and the Grok
  "NOT REGISTERED" branch incremented `fixed` without ever incrementing
  `issues`, corrupting the `issues == 0 || (fix && fixed == issues)`
  arithmetic in both directions: masking a genuinely unfixed issue, and
  reporting failure on a fully repaired machine.
- **`doctor --fix` could buy off a problem it could not fix.** Creating the
  default config counted a `fixed` with no matching `issues` (a missing config
  is a *warning*, not an issue), so that one success cancelled a genuinely
  unfixed issue through the `fixed == issues` equality: on a machine whose hook
  was misconfigured and unwritable, `dcg doctor --fix --strict` reported "All
  issues fixed!" and exited 0. Both renderers now count the issue each repair
  resolves, and a test asserts `fixed <= issues`.
- **`doctor --strict` gave different answers per `--format`.** The Grok
  registration check existed only in the pretty renderer, so a machine with
  Grok present and unwired exited 1 with `dcg doctor --strict` and 0 with
  `--format json`. The check now lives in the shared report (`grok_hook`) and a
  test pins that both renderers agree.
- **`gh repo delete` recommended a command dcg itself blocks.** Its first
  suggested alternative was `gh repo archive`, which the same pack denies, so
  the agent bounced between two denials. The suggestions now lead with a
  runnable command and say plainly that archiving is gated too. A pack test
  asserts no rule's first suggestion is blocked by its own pack.
- **`gh-api-delete-repo` is no longer a misnamed catch-all (#300).** The rule
  matched *any* `gh api ... DELETE`, not repository deletion, while its name is
  what surfaces as `rule_id` in the history DB, `dcg stats`, `dcg
  suggest-allowlist`, and allowlist entries. The catch-all is now
  `gh-api-delete-generic`, and `gh-api-delete-repo` matches what its name says:
  `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}`. Both are still denied, so no command changes
  verdict. **Breaking for persisted state:** an allowlist or `[rules]` entry for
  `platform.github:gh-api-delete-repo` now permits only repository deletion
  rather than every raw-API DELETE — a tightening — and history rows written
  before this release keep the old `rule_id`.

- **False positives:** `pwsh -File <script.ps1>` (and its abbreviation `-f`) is
  no longer denied as an unverifiable launcher envelope. `-File` was missing
  from the PowerShell host-option table entirely, so it resolved to `Unknown`
  and hit the fail-closed branch for unrecognized dash tokens — while the
  positional `pwsh <script.ps1>` form, which is the same operation, and
  `-Command`, which is strictly more dangerous, were both allowed. `-File` is
  now a first-class option that ends host-option parsing (later tokens are
  script arguments, not host options). `-File -` still refuses, because a
  script read from stdin is no more inspectable than `-Command -`. Routing it
  through the shared option table also means `pwsh -f -` is now recognized as
  reading a script from stdin, which the previous exact-match `-file` check in
  the pipeline analyzer missed.

## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.10.0) -- 2026-08-07 [Release]

A large correctness, feature, and hardening release from a full issue-triage
pass followed by an adversarial fresh-eyes review of that same work (which
caught, and this release fixes, four false-negatives the first pass had
introduced). It closes eighteen tracker issues, adds two new configuration and
pack-authoring surfaces, and lands the first two parts of the segment-scoped
evaluation design (#289). The evaluation hot path is unchanged for ordinary
commands; the new all-dialect fan-out and per-rule scoping only do extra work
when a command actually carries dialect-divergent syntax or an executable-scoped
pack is enabled.

### Added

- **Per-rule target-path exemptions (#284).** A new `[rules."<pack>:<pattern>"]`
  config table with `exempt_target_globs` lets a specific rule stand down when
  its operation targets a statically-literal path under an allowed glob (e.g.
  `~/.claude/jobs/*/tmp/**` for the `redirect-truncate`/`rm` rules that agent
  job-scratch directories collide with). Every other rule still evaluates the
  full command, so a destructive suffix is still caught — unlike an `[overrides]
  allow`, which is a whole-command bypass. Literal targets only (dynamic-path
  rules are deliberately unsupported); `..` traversal is rejected; the setting
  reduces coverage, so it is ignored from an automatically-discovered `.dcg.toml`
  and honored only from user/system/`DCG_CONFIG`. `dcg doctor` warns when it is
  configured on a rule that does not support it.
- **Rules can declare their executables (#289 part B).** Destructive patterns
  (built-in and external YAML packs, via a new `executables:` key) may name the
  executables they apply to; the engine then only evaluates such a rule against a
  command segment whose resolved `argv0` matches. `system.permissions` is the
  first migrated pack, so a `chmod` rule no longer fires on a `grep -r` elsewhere
  in the line. `executables` omitted preserves prior behavior exactly.
- **Diagnostics honesty (#289 part C).** `dcg test`/`dcg explain` now report when
  a denial comes only from the all-dialect analysis and the Bash hook (posix
  dialect) would allow — with the `--dialect posix` reproduction line and an
  additive `dialect_divergence` JSON field. `dcg test`/`dcg explain` invocations
  wrapped in loops, conditionals, or `&&` chains are no longer blocked on their
  own quoted argument.
- **Cross-pack regression corpus (#289 part D).** False-positive shapes from the
  closed issues are now replayed against every registered pack across all shell
  dialects on each test run, so a shape fixed under one rule is re-checked against
  the others. It found four new false positives on its first run (all fixed
  here).

### Security

- **Unknown-dialect evaluation no longer under-matches regex packs (#294).** A
  command inert under POSIX quoting but destructive under `cmd.exe`/PowerShell
  quoting (`echo 'ok & docker system prune -af`) is now caught under the default
  all-dialect analysis via a deny-wins fan-out, including caret- and
  backtick-obfuscated executables (`doc^ker`). The extra views run only when the
  command carries a dialect-divergent byte and an enabled-pack keyword.
- **Oversized hook input no longer silently skips evaluation (#290).** Padding a
  destructive command past `max_hook_input_bytes` previously failed open by
  default; the already-read buffer (drained up to a bounded cap) is now scanned
  for every embedded command and a destructive one is denied. The default
  fail-open posture for genuinely benign oversized input is unchanged.
- **The protocol denial is emitted before pending-exception persistence (#291),**
  so a slow or contended allow-once store can no longer delay or suppress a
  block.

### Fixed

- **False positives:** `chmod`/`chown`/`setfacl` no longer pair their flags with
  a different command in the same line, in any dialect (#287); the Cloudflare
  Wrangler semantic fallback requires actual Wrangler evidence, so `command -v
  foo`, `env`, and `time foo` are no longer denied (#283), and fully-dynamic
  executables (`$cmd $arg`) are no longer misattributed to it either;
  `core.git:branch-dynamic-token` no longer fires on non-git commands (#281); a
  variable expansion followed by a command substitution inside one double-quoted
  word parses correctly (#279); `git commit -F -` message bodies are treated as
  data on every scanning path (#277); literal paths under the per-user Windows
  temp directory are exempted like `/tmp` (#285).
- **Windows enforcement:** `rd /s` / `del /s` are blocked through the live
  PowerShell hook path, not only in `dcg test`/`explain` (#280).
- **Self-heal robustness (#292):** `~/.claude/settings.json` is now rewritten
  atomically (temp + fsync + rename) under a bounded lock, preserving symlinks
  and file mode, so a crash or a concurrent writer can no longer truncate it or
  drop its permissions.
- **External pack loading (#293)** is bounded by the hook deadline, caps glob
  matches and per-file size, and surfaces load failures without `--verbose`.
- **Installer:** the PowerShell profile check no longer prints a spurious "hook
  missing" warning when the hook command is present in its quoted-invocation form
  (#282).

### Internal

- The evaluation body was factored so the unknown-dialect path can replay it per
  dialect (#294); `argv0` resolution now walks the tokenizer and skips grouping
  punctuation, reserved words, `case` pattern lists, assignments, and wrappers so
  executable-scoped rules see the real command word inside compound constructs.
- Design decisions #289 A/B are staged: the corpus (D) is the regression net and
  `executables=` (B) migrates pack-by-pack; #288/#289 remain open as the anchors.


## [v0.6.6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.6) -- 2026-07-13 [Release]

Security and correctness release. Closes a critical, attacker-triggerable
guard-bypass (an exponential-time hang in command-substitution preprocessing),
enforces path-scoped allowlists across every evaluation entrypoint, lands
hook-protocol correctness fixes for Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, and VS Code
Copilot Chat, and adds heredoc/pack false-positive fixes plus a dependency
refresh.

### Security

- **Fix an exponential-time hang in command-substitution preprocessing that let
  a destructive command bypass the guard (#189).** A ~90-byte payload of a
  destructive command followed by ~30 unterminated `$(` drove
  `split_command_segments` into 2^n re-scans, hanging `dcg` far past its 200 ms
  hook budget; because agents fail open on a hung hook, the destructive command
  then executed. The command-substitution scanners now propagate an
  unterminated nested construct instead of rescanning the suffix per opener
  (2^n → linear, output-equivalent on well-formed input), and the matching
  blowup in the `$((` arithmetic/command-substitution disambiguation is closed
  too. `$(`, `<(`, `>(`, and `$((` openers are all bounded; a payload that
  previously hung now blocks in well under a millisecond.
- **Enforce path-scoped allowlists across all evaluation entrypoints (#186).**
  `paths = [...]` allowlist entries were silently applied globally whenever no
  heredoc content-allowlist project was configured, because the shared project
  path resolved to `None` and path-aware matchers skip path checks on `None`.
  The explicit working directory is now authoritative regardless of heredoc
  config, and the hook, `dcg test`, `dcg hook --batch`, and `dcg classify` all
  thread the real cwd; the heredoc-AST allowlist branches use the path-scoped
  matcher.

### Fixed

- **Restore enforcement on Codex CLI 0.144.x for native Windows (#183).** Codex
  denials now use its accepted minimal three-field `hookSpecificOutput` JSON
  with exit code 0. The previous exit-code-2 contract is collapsed to exit 1 by
  Codex's PowerShell wrapper, which Codex classifies as hook failure and then
  fails open. The new response is strict-parser-safe and retains the full
  operator explanation on stderr.
- **Honor GitHub Copilot CLI's native camelCase `preToolUse` protocol (#182).**
  Copilot responses now contain exactly its documented top-level
  `permissionDecision` and `permissionDecisionReason` fields, without legacy
  control or dcg-only metadata that caused the decision to be discarded. Unix
  and PowerShell installers now write a user-level hook under
  `${COPILOT_HOME:-~/.copilot}/hooks`, protecting every workspace; uninstallers
  remove that hook while preserving coexisting entries and also clean the
  legacy repo-local hook when present.
- **Protect VS Code Copilot Chat terminal tools (#184).** `runTerminalCommand`,
  `run_in_terminal`, and `runInTerminal` now route through the
  Claude-compatible deny protocol and read `tool_input.command`, covering both
  the documented and observed VS Code payload names.
- **Treat `spx session handoff` heredocs as structured stdin data (#181).** The
  narrowly-scoped, line-bounded sink masks handoff prose without masking other
  `spx` subcommands or commands after the heredoc terminator.
- **Stop inert prose in quoted no-op-builtin heredocs from tripping git/
  filesystem rules (#181).** `true <<'EOF' … EOF` and `: <<'EOF' … EOF` (the
  shell block-comment idiom) now have their bodies masked as data — but only for
  quoted delimiters, which suppress expansion. An unquoted delimiter still
  expands command substitutions, so those keep flowing through pack matching (no
  false negative), and commands after the terminator are unaffected.
- **Render pack styling and separate the legend in `dcg packs` (#187, #188).**
  Styled tree labels are parsed through `rich_rust`'s markup renderer instead of
  being emitted as literal `[bold]`/`[dim]`/`[green]` tags; unstyled labels keep
  literal brackets. The legend and config hint move out of the tree hierarchy
  into a footer beneath it.
- **Correct the dcg skill's missing-binary install guidance (#185).** All five
  managed skill copies now point to this repository and the working easy-mode
  installer instead of the nonexistent `anthropics/destructive-command-guard`
  URL; the public skill manifest checksum was refreshed and validated.
- **Keep catastrophic JavaScript deletes blocking under contention.** A
  lexer-aware pre-AST backstop catches literal `fs.rmSync()` calls targeting
  catastrophic paths before the bounded AST worker can fail open, while
  ignoring comments, template text, and non-catastrophic targets.

### Security and maintenance

- Upgrade `self_update` to `1.0.0-rc.4` and narrow `rich_rust` to the Markdown
  feature, removing the obsolete syntax-parser dependency stack while retaining
  dcg's purpose-built regex highlighter. `cargo audit` reports no known
  vulnerabilities.
- Make AST-heavy protocol tests deterministic on saturated CI hosts without
  changing the production 20 ms fail-open ceiling, and expand the platform
  backtracking audit plus PowerShell/batch extractor documentation sentinels.

### Documentation

- **Correct the modular-pack docs (#187, #190).** README, `docs/agents.md`, and
  `docs/configuration.md` now use real pack/category IDs and document that a
  category ID (e.g. `database`) expands to all its sub-packs, including in
  agent-profile `extra_packs`/`disabled_packs`; the bogus
  `extra_packs = ["paranoid"]` / `["core","database","filesystem"]` examples are
  replaced, and `"paranoid"` is clarified as a graduation mode, not a pack.
- **Document the stdin/pipe/redirection REPL bypass as a known limitation
  (#191).** A destructive payload reaching a stdin-driven REPL binary
  (`redis-cli`/`psql`/`mysql`/`mongosh`/`sqlite3`) via a pipe, `<` redirection,
  or command substitution used as an argument is not yet traced (direct args and
  here-strings are still blocked); a data-flow-aware fix is tracked separately.

## [v0.6.5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.5) -- 2026-07-02 [Release]

Security re-release of v0.6.4 with correct per-architecture binaries. No code
changes from v0.6.4 — this exists solely to publish a correctly-packaged
release through the CI pipeline.

### Fixed

- **Cross-architecture release binaries are now built for the correct target
  (#174).** The `v0.6.4` `dist` build installed the cross-target std against the
  floating `@nightly` toolchain instead of the `nightly-2026-06-06` pinned in
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, so the two cross-std targets
  (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`) failed to build with
  `error[E0463]: can't find crate for core`. Because `release` needs `build`,
  that skipped the GitHub-Actions publish and forced an out-of-band fallback
  that shipped **wrong-arch binaries**: the `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` tarball
  carried an x86-64 ELF and the `x86_64-apple-darwin` tarball carried an arm64
  Mach-O. On `aarch64` Linux the installed guard could not execute
  (`Exec format error`), and because Claude Code hooks are fail-open by design,
  the guard was silently dead while appearing installed — every destructive
  command was permitted with no visible error. The toolchain install now pins
  `nightly-2026-06-06` and adds the target std to it, so all six targets build
  on native runners and publish through CI. Explicit per-target arch-verify
  gates (`file` / `objdump -T`) already guard against a recurrence.

## [v0.6.4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.4) -- 2026-06-27 [Release]

Toolchain-pin release; superseded by v0.6.5 (its cross-arch tarballs were
mispackaged — see #174 above).

### Changed

- **Pin the toolchain to `nightly-2026-06-06`.** Bare `nightly` could no longer
  compile `rustix 1.1.4`, which had shipped v0.6.3 as Windows-only and broke
  fresh installs on newer distros. Restores the full platform set and bundles
  the 18-issue CLI/hook audit, the #160 fail-closed hardening
  (BOM-strip + opt-in `DCG_FAIL_CLOSED` + protocol-aware denial + oversized-input
  handling), and #151/#150/#155.

## [v0.6.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.3) -- 2026-06-25 [Release]

Patch release for Windows command normalization coverage.

### Fixed

- **Block wrapper flag-value command substitutions.** `env` and `sudo` wrapper
  normalization no longer strips option values that contain command/process
  substitutions, preserving destructive payloads for detection.
- **Normalize quoted Windows binary paths with backslashes.** Quoted paths such
  as `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" reset --hard` now normalize to the
  `git` command instead of being mangled by escape handling.
- **Tighten quick-reject keyword coverage.** Windows uppercase destructive
  aliases and Redis-compatible `valkey-cli` / `keydb-cli` commands now reach the
  destructive pattern matchers instead of being skipped by the fast path.

## [v0.6.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.2) -- 2026-06-25 [Release]

Patch release for the native-Windows installer.

### Fixed

- **Fix checksum resolution on Windows PowerShell 5.1.** GitHub release
  sidecars such as `dcg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip.sha256` can be returned by
  `Invoke-WebRequest` as `byte[]` when uploaded as octet-stream assets. The
  installer now decodes byte-array checksum content as UTF-8 before parsing,
  so the pinned one-liner verifies and installs the Windows zip correctly.

## [v0.6.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.1) -- 2026-06-25 [Release]

Patch release candidate for the native-Windows launch, superseding the
unpublished `v0.6.0` tag.

### Fixed

- **Close an inline-script extraction under-block.** Interpreter wrapper flags
  whose values are not simple barewords (`python -W ignore::... -c`, `node
  --max-old-space-size 4096 -e`, `bash --rcfile /path -c`, PowerShell
  `-Version 5.1 -Command`, and attached Perl flags like `-MFile::Spec`) are now
  skipped correctly before extracting the dangerous inline script payload.
- **Refresh Windows release docs.** README and `docs/windows.md` now describe
  Windows x64 + ARM64 artifacts, the ARM64-to-x64 fallback for older releases,
  the Windows Cursor PowerShell bridge, and the full PowerShell uninstall hook
  coverage.

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.6.0) -- 2026-06-24 [Tag]

Native Windows support, PowerShell installer automation, Windows release
artifacts, heredoc data-sink masking for `git` stdin targets, plus a soundness
fix to heredoc target resolution.

### Added

- **Native-Windows destructive-command protection.** New `windows.filesystem`
  and `windows.system` packs are **on by default on Windows** — blocking cmd
  `del /s`, `rd /s`, `format <drive>:`, PowerShell `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`
  (and aliases), `Clear-Content`/`Clear-RecycleBin`, plus `vssadmin delete
  shadows` / `wmic shadowcopy delete` (Volume Shadow Copy destruction),
  `diskpart`, `Format-Volume`, `Clear-Disk`, `cipher /w`, and `bcdedit /delete`.
  Opt-in `windows.misc` (`reg delete`, `net user /delete`, `wsl --unregister`,
  `robocopy /MIR`) and `windows.powershell` (registry/provider deletes,
  `Remove-LocalUser`, `Disable-ComputerRestore`, `Remove-VM`, …) packs round out
  coverage. All patterns are case-insensitive.
- **Windows-aware engine + scan.** Command normalization handles drive-letter
  paths (`C:\Windows\System32\del.exe`) and case-insensitive verbs; `dcg scan`
  now extracts commands from PowerShell (`.ps1`/`.psm1`/`.psd1`) and batch
  (`.cmd`/`.bat`) scripts.
- **Windows install one-liner + docs.** README gains the PowerShell
  `& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm ".../install.ps1"))) -EasyMode -Verify`
  installer; new [`docs/windows.md`](docs/windows.md) documents Windows behavior,
  paths (`%ProgramData%\dcg` system layer), and limitations.
- **Windows CI.** A `check (windows)` job (clippy + full test suite on
  `windows-latest`, nightly/MSVC) now guards against Windows regressions.

### Fixed

- **Stop false positives on `git` commit/object messages read from stdin (#136,
  data-sink half).** `git commit -F -`, `git commit --file=-` / `--file -` /
  `-F-`, and `git hash-object --stdin` consume the heredoc body as *data* (a
  commit/tag/note message or object content) that git never executes as shell.
  Their heredoc body is now masked out of the raw-shell rescan exactly like
  `cat`/`tee` (#109), so a commit message that merely contains "restore" or
  "reset --hard" no longer trips the `core.git:*` rules. The unsound
  interpreter-stdin case (`python3 -`/`node -`, whose body *is* executed) remains
  deliberately unmasked.
- **Soundness: heredoc target resolution is now bounded to the heredoc's own
  physical line.** `tokenize_backwards` does not treat newlines as command
  boundaries, so an unbounded backward scan could resolve a data-sink target (or
  the new git stdin sentinel) from an *earlier* line and mask a *later*,
  genuinely-executing heredoc body — e.g. `cat f\nbash <<EOF\nrm -rf /\nEOF` or
  `git commit -F - f\nbash <<EOF\nrm -rf /\nEOF` were wrongly allowed. Both
  `extract_heredoc_target_command` and the new `is_git_stdin_data_sink` now scan
  only the heredoc operator's own line. This closes a false negative (the
  conservative direction: at worst a false positive, never a missed destructive
  command). Found via adversarial review.

## [v0.5.6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.6) -- 2026-05-26 [Release]

Port of upstream changes from commits #125-#141.

### Added

- **Kamal deploy pack (`platform.kamal`).** Protects against destructive Kamal 2.x
  operations: `kamal remove` (full teardown, critical), `kamal accessory remove`
  (deletes data directory, critical), `kamal app remove|stop`,
  `kamal proxy remove|reboot|stop`, `kamal accessory reboot|stop` (high), and
  `kamal prune` (medium). Read-only inspection, deploy/redeploy, reversible
  lifecycle, rollback, and meta commands are whitelisted (closes #141).
- **Antigravity CLI (`agy`) guard support.** Full first-class support for Google's
  Antigravity CLI successor to Gemini CLI. New `HookProtocol::Antigravity` +
  `Agent::Antigravity` variant. `agy` nests its tool call under a `toolCall` object;
  shell command read from `toolCall.args.CommandLine`. Detected via
  `ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID` env var or `agy` parent process name.
  `dcg install --agy` writes hooks to `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`.
  Blocks emit `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` with exit 0 (F5).

### Fixed

- **PowerShell tool names on Codex (Windows).** PowerShell tool names are now
  unconditionally classified as Codex protocol, even without `turn_id`. On Windows,
  Codex drives shell commands through PowerShell but does not always populate
  `turn_id`. A PowerShell tool name is only ever emitted by Codex-style payloads —
  Claude Code's shell tool is always "Bash" (closes #125).
- **Built-in inspection-wrapper exemption.** Commands like
  `ee preflight check --cmd "<destructive>"` are now allowed — they analyze
  destructive commands as data, not instructions. Uses `command_prefix_safely_matches`
  with anti-injection guards (closes #132).
- **Close redirect-tail bypass in inspection-wrapper exemption.** Bare I/O redirect
  operators (`>`, `<`, `>>`) in the tail are now treated as shell metacharacters,
  preventing bypass via `ee preflight check --cmd foo > /etc/passwd` (followup to #132).
- **Heredoc: language-aware string-literal scanning for interpreter-stdin heredocs.**
  Interpreter-stdin (`python3 -`/`node -`) heredoc bodies are now language-aware:
  string literals are scanned properly to distinguish data from executable code (#136).
- **Heredoc: mask git stdin data sinks.** `git commit -F -`, `git hash-object --stdin`
  heredoc bodies are masked (treated as data, not shell code), so commit messages
  containing "restore" or "reset --hard" no longer false-positive (#136).
- **Heredoc: stop masking interpreter-stdin bodies.** `python3 -`/`node -` bodies
  remain deliberately unmasked because their body IS executed (#136, close false-negative gap).
- **Heredoc: target resolution bounded to one line.** Prevents unbounded backward
  scan from masking genuinely-executing heredoc bodies (#136, soundness fix).
- **cosign signature verification.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now probe whether
  cosign supports `--new-bundle-format` before passing it, so an old cosign on PATH
  doesn't abort the install (closes #140).
- **Pi agent integration recipe.** New `docs/pi-integration.md` with a ready-to-use
  `dcg-guard.ts` extension for Pi coding agent (closes #133).
- **Correct no-config default pack set documentation.** Fixes the default pack
  count and adds `platform.kamal` to the pack reference (closes #138).

### Dependencies

- Bump rust-minor-patch group: 5 updates (#134), 12 updates (#139).
- Bump codecov/codecov-action from 6 to 7 (#137).

## [v0.6.0-rc.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard) -- 2026-05-24 [Pre-release]

### New: `dcg-core` library crate + permission-modes API

dcg becomes embeddable as a Rust library, not just a binary hook. The new
[`dcg-core`](dcg-core/) crate (also published on crates.io as
`dcg-core = "0.6"`) provides a small, stable, low-dep API that consumer
applications (jcode, Codex, Hermes, Grok, agent SDKs, …) can link directly.

**Public API:**

```rust
use dcg_core::{Engine, EngineConfig, Mode, Session, ToolCall, Effect, Decision};

let engine = Engine::new(EngineConfig::builder()
    .working_dir("/work/project")
    .protected_paths(vec!["~/.ssh".into(), ".git".into()])
    .build());
let mut session = Session::with_working_dir("/work/project".into());

let decision = engine.evaluate(
    &mut session,
    &ToolCall::bash("git status"),
    Mode::Plan,
    &[Effect::Read],
);
// → Decision::Allow
```

**Key types:**

- **`Mode { Default, AcceptEdits, Plan, DontAsk, BypassPermissions, Auto }`** —
  permission modes mirroring [Claude Code's permission docs][cc-permissions].
- **`ToolCall { Bash, Edit, Write, Read, Network }`** — tool-aware payloads;
  consumer maps native tool taxonomy onto these five variants.
- **`Effect { Read, Write, Network, Spawn, Irreversible, MutateVcs, Fs }`** —
  effect taxonomy used by Plan/AcceptEdits/Auto policies.
- **`Decision { Allow, Prompt, Deny }`** — three-state outcome with
  `allow_once_code` (single-use, 24h TTL) and safer-alternative `alternatives`.
- **`Session`** — per-agent-run state replacing v0.5's global `SessionTracker`
  Mutex. Owns the allow-once cache, deny counter, and working dir.

### Effect tags on rules

Destructive rules can now declare an `effects` slice. The v0.6 evaluator
combines per-rule (Tier-A) and per-pack (Tier-B) tags to feed the mode
policy:

- **Tier-A explicit (~30-50 rules)** in `core.git` and `core.filesystem`:
  - `core.git:reset-hard` → `[MutateVcs, Irreversible]`
  - `core.git:push-force-long/short` → `[MutateVcs, Network, Irreversible]`
  - `core.git:clean-force` → `[Write, Fs, Irreversible]`
  - `core.git:branch-force-delete` / `stash-drop` / `stash-clear` → `[MutateVcs, Irreversible]`
  - `core.git:checkout-discard*` / `restore-worktree*` → `[Write, Fs, Irreversible]`
  - `core.fs:rm-rf-general/root-home`, `find-delete-*`, `dd-overwrite-*`,
    `shred-*`, `tar-remove-files-*`, `truncate-zero-*`, `redirect-truncate-*`,
    `unlink-*` → `[Write, Fs, Irreversible]`
- **Tier-B pack defaults**:
  - `core.git` → `[MutateVcs, Write]`
  - `core.filesystem` → `[Write, Fs]`
  - all other packs → `[Write, Irreversible]` (the conservative
    `DEFAULT_PACK_EFFECTS` constant)

### YAML pack schema extension

External (custom) packs can declare both fields. Both are optional —
v0.5 packs load unchanged.

```yaml
schema_version: 1
id: example.pack
default_effects: [mutate_vcs, write]   # NEW: pack-level Tier-B fallback
destructive_patterns:
  - name: yeet
    pattern: \byeet\b
    effects: [irreversible, write, fs] # NEW: per-rule Tier-A override
```

`docs/pack.schema.yaml` updated with the new fields and an `effect` enum
definition (`read | write | network | spawn | irreversible | mutate_vcs | fs`).

### Bridging existing pack evaluator

The `destructive_command_guard` crate gains
`destructive_command_guard::evaluate_with_mode` (and
`evaluate_with_mode_and_packs`) which combines the legacy pack-rule
pipeline with the new mode policy in one call. Existing shell-out
consumers can drop the subprocess and link the library:

```rust
let decision = destructive_command_guard::evaluate_with_mode(
    "git push --force",
    &config, &keywords, &overrides, &allowlists,
    &engine, &mut session, Mode::Default,
);
```

### Backward compatibility

- v0.5 binary clients (CLI shell-out) continue to work unchanged.
- v0.5 YAML packs without `effects` / `default_effects` load unchanged.
- v0.5 verdicts (`Allow` / `Deny`) on destructive rules are unchanged;
  v0.6 only changes how `Mode::Plan` / `Mode::AcceptEdits` interpret
  unmatched and tier-A-tagged rules.
- `tests/pack_schema_compat.rs` enforces these invariants in CI.

### Tests

- `dcg-core`: 52 unit + 34 integration (`tests/permission_modes.rs`,
  Mode × ToolCall × Effect matrix) + 2 doc tests = **88 tests, all pass**.
- `destructive_command_guard`: existing test suite unchanged + 7 new
  backward-compat tests + 3 new permission-modes bridge tests.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean on dcg-core.
- `cargo fmt --check` clean on dcg-core.

### Documentation

- New: [`docs/permission-modes.md`](docs/permission-modes.md) — full
  Mode/Effect/Decision reference with decision-flow diagram.
- New: [`docs/integration-guide.md`](docs/integration-guide.md) — Rust
  embedding guide, tool-taxonomy mapping examples, allow-once flow,
  bridging from shell-out consumers.
- Updated: [`docs/pack.schema.yaml`](docs/pack.schema.yaml) with
  `default_effects` (pack-level) and per-rule `effects` field.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- `Mode::Auto` LLM classifier — variant reserved, currently routes as
  `Default` (Phase C).
- Full migration of evaluator/packs/scan **into `dcg-core`** — the
  workspace is now split into `dcg-core` (lightweight library) and
  `dcg-cli` (the existing binary + heavy deps). Moving the evaluator
  and pack registry from `dcg-cli` into `dcg-core` is Phase 2 follow-up
  work; not required for jcode/Codex/Hermes/Grok integration since
  they only need the `dcg-core` API surface.

### Workspace layout

```
destructive_command_guard/      ← repo root (workspace)
├── Cargo.toml                  ← [workspace] members + shared profiles
├── crates/
│   ├── dcg-core/               ← v0.6 library, minimal deps
│   │   └── …
│   └── dcg-cli/                ← legacy library + `dcg` binary, heavy deps
│       ├── src/
│       ├── tests/
│       ├── benches/

├── docs/                       ← workspace docs
├── fuzz/                       ← targets dcg-cli
└── …
```

Consumers depending on the binary: no change. The `dcg` binary still
ships from `dcg-cli` and behaves identically (with the new
`--mode <NAME>` flag opt-in).

Consumers using the library:
- Lightweight: `dcg-core = "0.6"` (minimal deps).
- Heavy:       `dcg-cli  = "0.6"` (re-exports `dcg_core::*`,
                                    plus pack registry, scan engine,
                                    history, MCP server, …).

## [v0.5.5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.5) -- 2026-05-26 [Release]

Fixes the history full-text-search rebuild, which was broken by an upstream
FrankenSQLite bug.

### History FTS

- **`rebuild_fts` / FTS-backed history no longer raise `Sqlite(PrimaryKeyViolation)`.**
  FrankenSQLite did not intercept `DELETE` against a live FTS5 virtual table: the
  generic table-delete emptied the backing B-tree but left the in-memory FTS5
  module instance stale, so the `DELETE FROM commands_fts; <re-INSERT>` rebuild
  pattern collided on re-insert of the same rowid. Fixed upstream in
  [frankensqlite#94](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/issues/94)
  (commit `a0425adb` — live virtual-table DELETE now routes through the module's
  per-row `xUpdate` delete, matching SQLite). dcg pins that fix via a git rev of
  `fsqlite`/`fsqlite-types`/`fsqlite-error`. The three previously-failing
  `history::schema` FTS tests now pass.

### Packaging note

- This release is distributed as **GitHub-release binaries** (the primary install
  path). Because it pins FrankenSQLite to a git revision pending an `fsqlite`
  crates.io release, **v0.5.5 is not published to crates.io**; the registry stays
  at v0.5.4 for the guard feature (the FTS-rebuild fix lands there once `fsqlite`
  publishes the fix).

---

## [v0.5.4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.4) -- 2026-05-25 [crates.io only — no GitHub binaries]

Published to **crates.io** (first registry publish of the 0.5.x line since
v0.4.5), but the GitHub-release binaries did **not** ship: the `dist` run was
blocked first by `cargo fmt`/clippy and then by the FrankenSQLite FTS5 bug above.
GitHub binaries resume at v0.5.5.

First successful release and crates.io publish of the 0.5.x line since v0.4.5:
v0.5.0–v0.5.2 were cut as GitHub releases but never published to the registry,
and v0.5.3's `dist` run failed at `cargo fmt --check`, so it shipped nothing.
v0.5.4 carries the v0.5.3 fixes forward and adds the items below. Closes
[#126](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/126).

### Codex on Windows

- **dcg now descends into `powershell -Command` / `pwsh -c` inline scripts** ([#125](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/125)).
  Codex on Windows executes shell commands via `powershell.exe -Command '<cmd>'`.
  dcg previously unwrapped only `bash -c` / `sh -c`, so a destructive command
  inside the PowerShell wrapper reached the shell unevaluated. The inline-script
  extractor now unwraps `powershell` / `pwsh` — including the quoted full-path
  `"C:\…\powershell.exe" -Command '…'` form and the `-c` abbreviation — and
  re-evaluates the inner command against every pack. Note: whether Codex on
  Windows actually *fires* the PreToolUse hook for its `command_execution` event
  is Codex-side behavior; this change guarantees that once a wrapped command
  reaches dcg, it is caught.
- **`uninstall.ps1` also writes `hooks.json` as UTF-8 without a BOM**, matching
  the `install.ps1` fix; both installer and uninstaller now preserve array-ness
  when reading an existing hook config.

### Installer

- **`install.sh` installs shell completions for the invoking user, not root,
  when run under `sudo`** — completions land in the caller's config directories.

### Tests

- Added an end-to-end regression test for the [#124](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/124)
  multi-line `git commit -m "…git push --force…"` body case, and dropped an
  overclaimed pack-level assertion that cannot hold at the raw-regex layer
  (documented inline) — the multi-line body is defended by `-m` masking in the
  full `evaluate_command` pipeline, not by `pack.check()`.

### Packaging

- Slimmed the published crate via `exclude` (drops `.ntm/`, `*.png`, `*.webp`,
  `agent_baseline/`, `action/`). Source and binary are unaffected.

---

## [v0.5.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.3) -- 2026-05-23 [Release]

### Pattern false-positive fixes

- **`push-force-{long,short}` no longer fires across shell-token boundaries** ([#124](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/124)).
  The walker `(?:\S+\s+)*` between `git`/`push` and the force flag matched
  `\S` greedily, which includes shell metacharacters (`&;|`()<>` plus
  backticks). That meant `git commit -m "...git push --force..."`,
  here-doc bodies, `&&`-chained `echo` lines, and `git log --grep='git
  push --force'` all tripped the Critical rule — and dcg refused the
  entire command. Switched both regexes to the bounded form already
  used by `branch-force-delete` since [#121](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/121):
  `(?:[^\s&;|`()<>]+\s+)*`. Added five regression cases covering the
  shell-boundary scenarios.

### Codex on Windows

- **`install.ps1` now writes `hooks.json` as UTF-8 without the BOM** ([#125](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/125)).
  The previous `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` on Windows PowerShell 5.1
  (the default on Win10/Win11) prepended a UTF-8 BOM that Codex Desktop
  rejected with `expected value at line 1 column 1`. The hook installed
  cleanly, appeared in the Codex UI, and silently did nothing. Switched
  both write paths to `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` with
  `System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false` — works identically on PS 5.1 and
  PS 6/7+ without the PS6-only `-Encoding UTF8NoBOM`.

### crates.io

- **Intended as the first crates.io publish since v0.4.5 — but the `dist` run
  for v0.5.3 failed at `cargo fmt --check`, so no binaries or crate were
  published.** Superseded by v0.5.4, which completes the publish ([#126](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/126)).

---

## [Unreleased] (after v0.5.1)

### Agent support

- **Grok (xAI) protocol added as a first-class agent and hook target.**
  dcg now detects Grok CLI / Grok Build TUI and emits its native JSON wire
  shape so blocking actually sticks when Grok invokes shell tools.
  - **Detection.** Grok is recognised by any of three environment variables
    (`GROK_SESSION_ID`, `GROK_HOOK_EVENT`, `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`) and by
    parent-process basename (`grok`, `grok-cli`, `grok-build`). The hook
    protocol is auto-selected when stdin carries `hookEventName: "pre_tool_use"`
    or `toolName: "run_terminal_cmd"`, with explicit guards so the
    Hermes (`pre_tool_call`) and Copilot (`event` / `tool_args`) markers
    still win on their own payloads.
  - **Wire shape.** Denies emit `{"decision":"deny","reason":"…", …}` on
    stdout — *not* Hermes' `"block"`. Allows are empty stdout + exit 0.
    Warns become explicit `{"decision":"allow","reason":"DCG warn: …"}`
    so Grok logs the advisory without escalating to a block.
  - **Installer.** `dcg install --grok` writes a self-contained
    `~/.grok/hooks/dcg.json` (`PreToolUse` / `matcher: "Bash"`, which Grok
    internally aliases to `run_terminal_cmd`). `--grok --project` writes
    `<repo>/.grok/hooks/dcg.json` for per-repo installs. Grok also picks dcg
    up via the existing `~/.claude/settings.json` compatibility layer, so
    users who already ran `dcg install` get protection with no further
    action.
  - **Doctor.** `dcg doctor` adds a "Checking Grok hook registration…" line
    when a `.grok/` directory or `GROK_*` env var is present. `dcg doctor
    --fix` will write the native hook for you if it's missing. The check is
    silent on hosts that have never had Grok installed, to avoid noise.
  - **Tests.** Eight new protocol-detection tests plus full
    denial/warning JSON-shape assertions in `hook::tests`, three new env
    detection tests in `agent::env_tests`, and CLI parse coverage for
    `--grok`/`--grok --project`. Closes the contribution proposals in
    [#117](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/pull/117)
    and [#118](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/pull/118)
    by reimplementing the feature independently, including the corrected
    user-level hook path (`~/.grok/hooks/dcg.json`, not `~/.grok/settings.json`)
    and the correct block keyword (`"deny"`, not `"block"`).

### Release-engineering fixes

- **Linux x86_64 now ships as static musl** ([#114](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/114)).
  Previous releases linked against the build runner's glibc and required
  GLIBC ≥ 2.39 on the host, which blocked Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and any
  long-support distro. The dist matrix now uses `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
  with the `rustls` feature on `self_update` so OpenSSL isn't dragged in,
  plus an `objdump -T | grep GLIBC_` post-build check that fails the
  release if the binary unexpectedly re-acquires glibc symbols.
  `install.sh` was updated to map `linux-x86_64` to the musl target by
  default, with a one-shot HEAD-probe fallback to the legacy gnu artifact
  for older pinned versions so the transition doesn't break users who
  ask for an older version explicitly.

- **aarch64 release artifact verified at build time** ([#112](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/112)).
  v0.5.1's `dcg-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` published an x86-64
  ELF binary. Native ARM runners in the current matrix make that
  impossible by construction, but a `file <target>/release/dcg | grep
  aarch64` post-build check now fails the release if the architecture
  ever drifts again.

## [v0.5.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.1) -- 2026-05-03 [Release]

Patch release after v0.5.0 covering two false-positive/false-negative classes
discovered during a wide review of recent agent-authored fixes: the heredoc
parser's handling of the `<<-` / `<<~` markers and a missed-coverage gap in
the compact `-XDELETE` / `--request=DELETE` / `--method=DELETE` curl/glab API
forms. 5 commits since v0.5.0.

### Heredoc parser hardening (issue #109)

- Consumed whitespace between the `<<-` / `<<~` marker and the delimiter so
  bash-legal forms like `cat <<- 'EOF'` no longer fall through the
  quoted-delimiter strip and bail out unmasked. Pre-fix the body escaped
  masking, and pack matching denied prose like "gh repo delete" inside a
  heredoc fed to a non-executing target ([f3c96bd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/f3c96bd),
  test coverage added in [a739dc9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a739dc9)
  and [03bf276](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/03bf276)).
- Disambiguated `cat << -EOF` (whitespace before the dash, delimiter is
  literally `-EOF`) from `cat <<-EOF` (tab-strip marker, delimiter is `EOF`)
  by gating the marker classification on `skip_whitespace == 0`. Same fix
  applied to `~` so `cat << ~TILDE` is also a Standard heredoc with
  delimiter `~TILDE`. Aligned the manual `parse_heredoc_delimiter` path with
  the regex-based `extract_heredocs` path so both correctly map `~` to
  `IndentStripped` rather than `TabStripped`. Without this, a `cat <<~EOF`
  with space-indented body lines and a space-indented terminator was never
  recognized by the masker, the body escaped masking, and pack matching
  produced false positives on documentation prose like `rm -rf /` inside
  the heredoc body
  ([a8a0a8d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a8a0a8d)).

### Compact curl / glab API method forms

- Closed a false-negative gap where four destructive-pattern regexes still
  required whitespace between `-X` / `--request` / `--method` and the HTTP
  verb. Pre-fix bypasses such as `glab api -XDELETE
  projects/123/variables/SECRET`, `glab api --method=DELETE
  /projects/123/protected_branches/main`, `curl -XDELETE
  https://splunk.example.com:8089/services/data/inputs/abc`, and `curl
  --request=DELETE
  https://circleci.com/api/v2/.../envvar/FOO` slipped through unblocked
  because curl and glab's cobra-based CLI accept those compact short forms
  and equals long forms. Aligned the affected packs with the broader
  `(?:-X\s*|--request(?:=|\s+))VERB` shape already used by `gh api`,
  Datadog, PagerDuty, Prometheus, New Relic, Meilisearch, and the email
  packs, and added regression tests for each block
  ([1fdfbec](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/1fdfbec)).

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.5.0) -- 2026-05-02 [Release]

Minor pre-1.0 release after v0.4.11 for the Codex hardening wave, installer
preservation work, Railway/API guard improvements, and the latest safe-pattern
bypass fixes. This release covers 75 commits since v0.4.11.

### Codex & Multi-Agent Hook Support

- Applied protocol-derived agent profiles, so Codex/Copilot/Gemini/Claude-style
  hook payloads can select the right agent profile without relying only on
  process environment detection
  ([7f7d67e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/7f7d67e)).
- Kept blank Codex `turn_id` fields from forcing the Codex stderr-deny path,
  preserving Claude-compatible JSON behavior for payloads that are not actually
  Codex hook events
  ([d0a1bef](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d0a1bef)).
- Hardened Copilot handling for PowerShell payloads, missing tool names, and
  warn-severity decisions so Copilot warnings remain non-stopping while denies
  still block
  ([e11baea](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/e11baea),
  [4862be4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/4862be4),
  [708536e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/708536e)).
- Added and expanded subprocess-level Codex protocol coverage, including
  hermetic HOME isolation, allow-once/allowlist parity, pack enablement,
  heredoc behavior, and cross-protocol block/allow shape checks
  ([tests/codex_hook_protocol.rs](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/blob/main/tests/codex_hook_protocol.rs)).

### Installer & Uninstaller Reliability

- Made Unix and Windows installers preserve malformed or user-owned hook
  configuration instead of overwriting it for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini
  CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Cursor IDE, and PowerShell hook payloads
  ([c55bf33](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/c55bf33),
  [1a4b015](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/1a4b015),
  [563d538](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/563d538),
  [46f3764](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/46f3764),
  [fba6067](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/fba6067)).
- Preserved coexisting user hooks while keeping dcg first in the relevant Bash
  hook lists, including mixed Copilot entries and existing Claude hooks
  ([792236e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/792236e),
  [85028ce](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/85028ce),
  [389ac52](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/389ac52)).
- Rejected empty or flag-shaped installer option values so arguments like
  `--version --system` fail as setup errors instead of treating `--system` as
  the version value
  ([e8cb117](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/e8cb117)).
- Matched uninstall ownership checks more exactly for Cursor, Codex,
  PowerShell, and non-dcg hook preservation so uninstallers remove only dcg's
  own entries
  ([6d71b68](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/6d71b68),
  [af68c72](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/af68c72),
  [b043068](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/b043068),
  [e8e65d1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/e8e65d1)).

### Railway & API Pack Hardening

- Expanded the Railway pack to recognize `Project-Access-Token` and
  `RAILWAY_TOKEN` signals, multiline API payloads, curl executable suffixes,
  and JSON database variable keys that can mutate production connection
  settings
  ([d6b49d5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d6b49d5),
  [6220da9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/6220da9),
  [586afff](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/586afff),
  [2193c67](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/2193c67)).
- Closed broad safe-pattern masking gaps across cloud, database, Kubernetes,
  package manager, backup, search, monitoring, feature flag, Kafka, and
  Ansible packs, including attached/equal curl methods and false dry-run text
  bypasses
  ([8e86dbc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/8e86dbc),
  [1a1c1b0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/1a1c1b0),

- Kept legitimate AWS S3 `--dryrun` previews allowed while blocking deceptive
  dry-run-looking strings in destructive contexts
  ([b5bea76](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/b5bea76)).

### Command Parsing, Agent Detection, and Update Safety

- Fixed shell redirection tokenization around attached `&>`, `&>>`, and `>&`
  forms so destructive append/truncate redirections are not split or hidden
  from filesystem rules
  ([87766f9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/87766f9),

  [616cd75](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/616cd75)).
- Reduced false positives in agent detection for domain/path substrings,
  wrapper-launched agents, and Windows shim-launched processes while recording
  the hook-protocol-detected agent type in history
  ([224f2f8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/224f2f8),

  [77bfbaf](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/77bfbaf)).
- Hardened `dcg update` so unknown latest installer tags fail closed, rollback
  pruning preserves the intended target, and backup artifact names are
  validated before use
  ([a4d467c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a4d467c),

## [v0.4.11](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.11) -- 2026-05-01 [Release]

Clean release target for the shell tokenization regression fix from v0.4.10.
This supersedes the quarantined v0.4.10 prerelease; no behavior changes were
made after v0.4.10.

### Release Hygiene

- Bumped the release version so official GitHub Actions can publish a clean
  asset set without overwriting or deleting the quarantined v0.4.10 fallback
  artifacts.

## [v0.4.10](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.10) -- 2026-05-01 [Pre-release]

Patch release after v0.4.9 for a shell tokenization regression found during
fresh-eyes review of nested command and process substitution handling.
This release was left as a prerelease and superseded by v0.4.11 after fallback
artifact publication produced an incomplete asset set.

### Shell Parsing

- Preserved shell parenthesized constructs such as `$()`, `<()`, and `>()`
  while tokenizing commands for normalization, preventing quotes inside nested
  command substitutions from corrupting the normalized command stream
  ([41d233a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/41d233a)).
- Masked quoted process-substitution-looking literals before Docker pack
  evaluation while still blocking real input and output process substitutions
  that execute destructive Docker commands
  ([41d233a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/41d233a)).

## [v0.4.9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.9) -- 2026-05-01 [Release]

Patch release after v0.4.8 for the remaining DCG-specific environment flag
semantics and release validation fixes that need to ship in prebuilt binaries.

### CLI Reliability

- Kept shell redirection ampersands such as `2>&1`, `>&2`, and `&>` inside
  the current command segment instead of splitting them as command separators,
  preserving correct downstream pack evaluation for redirected commands
  ([acf6803](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/acf6803)).
- Honored documented falsey values for `DCG_NO_COLOR` and `DCG_NO_RICH` in
  non-clap output paths, so values such as `0`, `false`, `no`, and `off` no
  longer disable colors or rich output by mere presence
  ([14f1aac](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/14f1aac)).
- Applied the same falsey-value semantics to `DCG_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` and
  `DCG_NO_SELF_HEAL`, so `0`, `false`, `no`, `n`, and `off` no longer disable
  update checks or self-healing by mere presence
  ([27ac314](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/27ac314)).
- Kept Linux-only allowlist process inspection imports behind a Linux cfg so
  macOS and Windows release builds stay warning-clean
  ([bdcbb9b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/bdcbb9b)).

### Railway Pack

- Blocked Railway Public API `variableCollectionUpsert` mutations that set
  `replace: true`, because omitted variables are deleted and this can remove
  production credentials even when no database variable name appears in the
  payload
  ([fb6431e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/fb6431e)).
- Kept that Railway replacement mutation detector on the linear regex path for
  predictable hook latency
  ([b7aa4e2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/b7aa4e2)).

### Release Validation

- Isolated the Codex subprocess memory test HOME so stale pending-exception
  state from previous local runs cannot turn an expected Codex deny into an
  allow during release gates
  ([29d870c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/29d870c)).

## [v0.4.8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.8) -- 2026-05-01 [Release]

Patch release after v0.4.7 for a CLI environment-variable parser fix that needs
to ship in prebuilt binaries.

### CLI Reliability

- Accepted documented truthy and falsey values for global boolean environment
  flags such as `DCG_NO_COLOR=1`, `DCG_QUIET=1`,
  `DCG_LEGACY_OUTPUT=1`, and `DCG_NO_SUGGESTIONS=1` instead of letting clap
  reject `1` as an invalid boolean ([0b350e3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/0b350e3)).

## [v0.4.7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.7) -- 2026-05-01 [Release]

Patch release after v0.4.6 focused on Codex/Gemini installer reliability, hook protocol compatibility, and closing safe-pattern masking gaps in destructive API packs.

### Codex & Installer Reliability

- Preserved invalid Codex `~/.codex/hooks.json` files instead of overwriting them during Unix installer runs, with an explicit failure reason in the install summary ([a3fc05a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a3fc05a)).
- Preserved malformed Codex hook shapes on both Unix and Windows installers, including non-object `hooks` values and non-list `PreToolUse` values, instead of replacing user-edited data ([7167be6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/7167be6), [f0ca794](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/f0ca794)).
- Removed self-service bypass commands from Codex-visible denial text, so Codex sees the block reason and an explicit no-bypass instruction instead of a command it can use to allowlist and rerun the destructive operation ([a4b9a84](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a4b9a84)).
- Made Gemini installer reruns reset `GEMINI_BACKUP` state at the start of `configure_gemini`, preventing stale backup paths from leaking between attempts ([762f3c7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/762f3c7)).
- Tightened Gemini hook detection so the installer recognizes the exact dcg hook shape and reports configuration failures rather than silently treating near-matches as success ([4c9fbb2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/4c9fbb2)).

### Hook & Pack Correctness

- Fixed Gemini warn-severity hook output to emit `decision = "allow"` instead of `ask`, matching Gemini's accepted hook contract ([5d70198](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/5d70198)).
- Prevented broad API safe patterns from masking destructive method-bearing requests across packs, including `curl -XDELETE`, `curl --request=DELETE`, and attached-method forms such as `-XDELETE` / `--request=DELETE` ([bdb297f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/bdb297f), [08ac8a3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/08ac8a3), [79915f4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/79915f4)).
- Blocked Redis mass key deletion pipelines and Prometheus destructive API calls that were previously hidden by overly broad safe `GET` handling ([41ec95d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/41ec95d), [9f01db0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/9f01db0)).
- Scoped Railway original-payload rechecks to relevant compound-command segments so safe Railway API queries are not tainted by unrelated text in later shell segments, while destructive Railway mutations remain blocked ([701630f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/701630f)).
- Blocked Railway API mutations split across shell line continuations ([3818efc](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/3818efc)).

### Pack Coverage

- Added Railway function deletion coverage ([f15bdf6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/f15bdf6)).
- Expanded the Google Cloud Storage pack to match `gcloud alpha storage` and `gcloud beta storage` release tracks ([a68ad66](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/a68ad66)).
- Refreshed the pattern-audit document after the storage.gcs keyword widening ([dc02ff4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/dc02ff4)).
- Hardened the real Codex E2E harness so relative `--dcg-binary` paths are canonicalized before hook configuration, and missing option values fail with a setup error instead of shifting later arguments ([cd1b612](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/cd1b612), [d11de4d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d11de4d)).

## [v0.4.6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.6) -- 2026-05-01 [Release]

Release 0.4.6 completed the larger post-v0.4.3 hardening wave documented below.

### Security Hardening

- **Railway platform protection pack** — added `platform.railway` to guard Railway CLI and Public API operations that can delete projects, environments, services, volumes, variables, and deployments. Critical rules cover project/environment/service/volume deletion and GraphQL deletion mutations (`projectDelete`, `projectScheduleDelete`, `environmentDelete`, `serviceDelete`, `volumeDelete`, `volumeInstanceDelete`). High-severity rules cover volume detach, variable deletion, database connection variable upserts (`DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, `MYSQL_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, etc.), and deployment removal/stops (`railway down`, `deploymentRemove`, `deploymentStop`). Read-only commands such as `railway status`, `railway list`, `railway service list`, `railway volume list`, and safe GraphQL queries remain allowed.
- **Recursive-force-delete bypass family** (`core.filesystem`): closed seven sibling-bypass families an agent could use after `rm -rf` is blocked.
  - `find ... -delete` on sensitive paths (Critical/High) — closes the `find -delete` path-bypass plus compound, subshell, and path-prefix variants.
  - `unlink <sensitive>` (Critical/High) — POSIX unlink(2) primitive.
  - `truncate -s 0|--size=0|-s -N` on sensitive paths (Critical/High) — in-place zero/shrink.
  - `shred [-u|--remove|-fzu] <sensitive>` (Critical/High) — DoD-style overwrite + optional unlink.
  - `tar --remove-files` on sensitive sources (Critical/High) — archive-then-delete masquerading as an archive operation; order-agnostic flag/source placement; `tar --remove-files -cf /dev/null /etc` (delete-only) blocked.
  - `dd of=<sensitive>` (Critical/High) — file-level overwrite (truncate-equivalent at the dd layer); operand-order agnostic; `dd of=/dev/null` (read-discard) and `dd if=/etc/passwd of=/tmp/passwd.bak` (backup) preserved; device-level dd (`of=/dev/sda`) is `system.disk`'s scope.
  - `mv <sensitive>` (Critical) — closes the canonical cross-segment bypass `mv /etc /tmp/x && rm -rf /tmp/x` where each segment is allowed individually but together destroys `/etc`. Blocks any mv that mentions a sensitive path (source OR destination) including in-place renames within /etc; tmp-family moves remain allowed.
  - Sensitive-source propagation chains (Critical) — blocks phase-1 data-flow bypasses for `cp -a/-al <sensitive> <tmp> && rm -rf <tmp>`, `ln -s <sensitive> <tmp> && rm -rf <tmp>/.`, and `rsync -a <sensitive> <tmp> && rm -rf <tmp>`. The filesystem rm fast-path now parses compound segments so ordinary temp cleanup stays allowed while propagation chains are classified before the rm fallback rules.
  - `> <sensitive>` (Critical) — Bash output redirects (`>`, `>|`, `&>`, `1>`, `2>` with optional `|` force-overwrite) truncate the target file to zero bytes; bare `> /etc/passwd`, `: > /etc/passwd`, `echo > /etc/passwd`, and numbered-FD variants all destroy file content via shell syntax alone (no destructive binary involved). Append (`>>`) is correctly preserved via negative lookbehind. Per scope decision: only the Critical root-home tier ships — a `-general` rule would block legitimate `make > build.log` workflows. Two supporting changes: (a) the `should_fallback_to_full_normalized_keyword_scan` quick-reject helper now fires whenever a redirect operator is present (previously gated on path-prefix normalization), so redirect keywords match outside the executable span; (b) `sanitize_for_pattern_matching` now exits all-args-data masking on redirect operators so `echo > /etc/passwd` no longer hides the destructive target.
- **mkswap rule added to `system.disk`** (`git_safety_guard-8kh4`) — `mkswap /dev/sdb` formats a partition as a swap area with the same blast radius as `mkfs`. Previously slipped through because mkswap is a separate binary and the existing `mkfs(?:\.[a-z0-9]+)?` regex only matched `mkfs.*` variants. Ships with the `mkswap` keyword in PACK_ENTRIES, a destructive `mkswap` rule (High), and a safe `mkswap-check` carve-out for read-only `mkswap --check` inspection.
- **`dcg update` verifies install.sh / install.ps1 before exec** (`git_safety_guard-ythp`) — `self_update_unix` previously did `curl -fsSL <script> | bash -s -- ...`: a tag-pinned but unverified pipe, so a GitHub account compromise that planted a malicious installer at the tag would run unchecked. New flow downloads the script to a tempfile, best-effort fetches `install.sh.sha256` from the matching GitHub Release (`releases/download/<tag>/install.sh.sha256`), verifies via `shasum -a 256 -c`, aborts on mismatch, and only then `bash`-execs the script. Tags published before this change have no `.sha256` artifact: the verifier emits a warning and proceeds (preserving the update path for stale binaries). PowerShell path mirrors the same flow with `Get-FileHash`. CI side: `dist.yml` now publishes `install.sh.sha256` / `install.ps1.sha256` plus matching cosign sigstore bundles for every release.
- **Cross-session graduated-response wiring** (`git_safety_guard-n9j1`) — `history_soft_block` / `history_hard_block` / `history_window` config fields were parsed and merged but never consulted by `determine_graduated_response`. For shell hooks (one process per `Bash` call) the in-process `session_count` never grows past 1, so Standard/Lenient modes never escalated across invocations. Added `determine_graduated_response_with_history` and `EvaluationResult::apply_graduation_with_history_db` that query `HistoryDb::count_command_blocks_in_window(command_hash, history_window_duration)` and escalate Standard/Lenient to SoftBlock/HardBlock when the cross-session count crosses the configured thresholds. Hot-path stays fail-open: any history query error falls back to session-only graduation. New `ResponseConfig::parse_history_window` helper accepts `s` / `m` / `h` / `d` suffixes. 7 new tests including legacy-signature equivalence and unit-parsing coverage.
- **History `inline_params` SQL substitution corruption fix** (`git_safety_guard-tovy`) — `history/schema.rs::inline_params` previously substituted `?N` placeholders via reverse-order `String::replace`. Reversal solved the `?10` vs `?1` ambiguity but did NOT prevent corruption when a substituted value contained text matching an earlier placeholder index (e.g. `params[4] = "?1"` would inject `'?1'` into the SQL, then the subsequent pass would re-substitute it into the value of `?1`). Replaced with a single-pass left-to-right walk that recognizes `?N` only outside single-quoted string literals, parses full digit runs, and writes substituted values to the output without rescanning. 7 new tests including the exact regression case (`params[1] = "?1"`) and SQLite's doubled-quote escape handling.
- **Unified SIGINT shutdown registry** (`git_safety_guard-i5gd`) — `main.rs` previously registered an ad-hoc ctrlc handler that flushed only the `HistoryWriter`. Refactored to a process-wide `SHUTDOWN_ACTIONS` registry: each subsystem with cross-call buffered state registers a flush closure at startup, and the SIGINT handler invokes them in order before `std::process::exit(130)`. Future stores plug in by calling `register_shutdown_action(...)` rather than adding ad-hoc logic to the signal handler.
- **Pending-exceptions JSONL bounded with rotation** (`git_safety_guard-f81d`) — `record_block` previously appended unbounded; long-running automations issuing many allow-once codes turned every `record_block` call into O(N) under an exclusive lock. New `MAX_PENDING_LINES` (10,000) cap triggers archival to `pending.jsonl.1` of the oldest half (with `OpenOptions::append` so prior archives accumulate, not overwrite). Hard `MAX_PENDING_BYTES` (10 MiB) refusal: if the live file is somehow still over that cap, `record_block` returns an error rather than continuing to grow. The hot path is now O(MAX_PENDING_LINES / 2) under the exclusive lock.
- **Bounded config-file reads + system-layer symlink rejection** (`git_safety_guard-tck0`) — `config::load_layer_from_file` and `allowlist::load_allowlist_file` previously called `fs::read_to_string` directly, so a 2 GiB symlinked file would be loaded entirely into memory before parsing failed. New `read_config_file_bounded` helper caps reads at `MAX_CONFIG_BYTES` (1 MiB, well above any sane TOML config) using `Read::take`. The system layer (`/etc/dcg/config.toml` and `AllowlistLayer::System`) additionally refuses to follow symlinks pointing at user-writable targets — a non-root user could otherwise influence privileged config by symlinking it into their home directory. Per-layer trust class is encoded as `ConfigSource::System` vs `Untrusted`.
- **Scan reporting: structured skip detail and missing-path warnings** (`git_safety_guard-jvkm` + `-eug4`) — `ScanReport.summary` now includes two new arrays in addition to the existing `files_skipped` total. `paths_skipped[]` lists top-level user-supplied target paths that didn't exist or were unreadable, with `reason: "path_not_found"` — surfaced via `tracing::warn!` so misconfigured CI invocations no longer silently exit zero with `files_scanned=0`. `skipped[]` records per-file skip detail with a `reason` enum (`metadata_error`, `not_a_regular_file`, `too_large`, `no_extractor`, `read_error`) so operators can distinguish `max-file-size` configuration issues from genuinely-non-script files.
- **Scan-mode heredoc-extraction timeout floor** (`git_safety_guard-s67a`) — `ScanEvalContext::from_config` now floors `heredoc_settings.limits.timeout_ms` at 200ms (`SCAN_HEREDOC_MIN_TIMEOUT_MS`). The hook hot path is a per-Bash-call budget where every microsecond matters; the scan path is offline (`dcg scan .` runs once, deliberately, and doesn't gate command execution). Inheriting the hot-path budget silently dropped matches whose extraction merely brushed the budget. User config values larger than the floor are still honored.
- **Pending-exception short codes are now 6 digits** (`git_safety_guard-suap`) — `short_code_from_hash` was a 5-digit decimal modulo of the trailing 32 bits, giving 100,000 codes and a birthday-paradox 50% collision threshold at ~370 active records. Bumped to 6 digits (1,000,000 codespace) which raises the threshold to ~1,175 active records — well above realistic per-day volume in a 24-hour TTL. `dcg allow-once <code>` and `dcg allowlist revoke <code>` accept legacy 5-digit codes from already-written `pending.jsonl` files.
- **`detached_head_strictness` config knob** (`git_safety_guard-6skk`) — `apply_branch_strictness` previously collapsed `BranchInfo::DetachedHead(_)` to `branch_name=None` and applied `default_strictness`. Detached HEAD typically signals rebase / bisect / checkout-of-tag — exactly the contexts where uncommitted work is most exposed. New `git_awareness.detached_head_strictness` field defaults to `All` (strictest); also configurable via `DCG_GIT_DETACHED_HEAD_STRICTNESS`. Set it to `default_strictness` for the previous loose behavior.
- **Agent detection no longer false-positives on substrings** (`git_safety_guard-bui6`) — `agent_from_process_name` previously used `executable.contains("claude")` / `"aider"` / `"continue"` / `"cursor"` etc., misclassifying any tool whose binary name merely contained an agent name (`claude-explorer`, `myproject-continue`, `cursor-ext`). The new implementation tokenizes the parent-process string on whitespace, takes each token's basename (lower-case, `\` → `/`, last path segment, strip `.exe`), and matches it against an explicit name/alias table. Wrapper invocations like `node /usr/local/bin/codex` continue to detect correctly because each argv token is checked independently.
- **Interactive prompt sanitizes attacker-controlled command** (`git_safety_guard-m1ic`) — `display_prompt` in `src/interactive.rs` now passes the blocked command and reason through `sanitize_for_display` before any styling. The helper strips CSI/OSC/2-byte ESC escapes (preventing terminal-title spoofing, fake prompt boundaries, color injection) and visualizes remaining C0/C1 control bytes as `\xNN` / `\n` / `\r` / `\t` so the human verifier sees the original bytes without the terminal acting on them.
- **system.disk pack promoted to default-on** (`PacksConfig::enabled_pack_ids`) — first-time users with empty config now get `mkfs`/`dd-to-/dev`/`fdisk`/`parted`/`mdadm`/`lvm`/`wipefs` protection without manual enablement. Opt-out via `disabled = ["system.disk"]` (or `disabled = ["system"]`).
- **Strict git pack**: expanded dangerous-command detection for additional destructive git patterns ([6d950f3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/6d950f3), [031e84a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/031e84a))
- Removed safe patterns in strict git pack that created a compound-command bypass ([d6ce202](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d6ce202))
- Podman `rm`/`rmi` combined-flag bypass (e.g. `podman rm -af`) ([d9d23b5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/d9d23b5))

### Hook & Agent Detection

- **Codex CLI PreToolUse hook support**: Codex CLI 0.125.0+ is supported via stable `~/.codex/hooks.json` PreToolUse hooks. dcg detects Codex hook input from the `turn_id` field and uses the strict stderr-deny contract with exit code 2 required by Codex, not the Claude/Gemini JSON-deny payload. The Unix installer writes `~/.codex/hooks.json` when Codex CLI is detected; Windows installs document the manual hook path while PowerShell parity is tracked separately. Closes [#84](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/84).
- Hook system expansion with additional interception patterns and strict git pack hardening ([031e84a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/031e84a))
- Disambiguate Claude Code from Gemini in `detect_protocol()` -- closes [#77](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/77) ([8815b54](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/8815b54))

### Output

- **Rich output is now enabled by default** (`bd-15p0`) — default Cargo builds include the `rich-output` feature and the `rich_rust` renderer, while `cargo build --no-default-features` remains the lean/plain fallback. The unused `legacy-output` Cargo feature placeholder was removed; runtime plain output is still available through `DCG_NO_RICH=1`, `NO_COLOR=1`, CI/non-TTY detection, or `--legacy-output`.

### Maintenance

- Clippy and rustfmt cleanup across CLI, hook, and pack modules ([c26f22d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/c26f22d))
- Test infrastructure: `large_dataset_insertion` test updated to use in-memory DB with manual seeding ([784e356](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/784e356))

## [v0.4.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/releases/tag/v0.4.3) -- 2026-03-14 [Tag]

A large release adding new agent detections, new protection packs, self-healing settings monitoring, and a session-scoped interactive allowlist system.

### Self-Healing & Resilience

- **Real-time `settings.json` overwrite detection and self-healing** -- DCG now watches for external processes silently removing its hook registration and restores it automatically ([708d202](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/708d202))
- `dcg setup` command with shell startup hook-removal detection -- closes [#56](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/issues/56) ([45db4b7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/45db4b7))
- Shell startup check to detect silently removed DCG hook ([eb06112](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/eb06112))
- Prevent duplicate shell check injection on re-runs ([8b70cab](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/8b70cab))

### New Protection Packs

- **Supabase database protection pack** -- full CLI coverage including `db push`, `db reset`, `migration repair`, `functions delete`, `secrets unset`, `storage rm`, `projects delete`, and more; `--dry-run` whitelisted as safe ([003a429](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/003a429), [3e3ed19](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/3e3ed19))

### Agent Detection & Protocol Support

- **Gemini CLI hook protocol support** with improved detection for minimal payloads ([ac6e6ad](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/ac6e6ad), [0629a5d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/0629a5d))
- **Augment Code** agent detection ([5917125](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/5917125))

## Initial Development -- 2026-01-07

The project began as `git_safety_guard`, a focused tool for blocking destructive git commands. It was renamed to **destructive_command_guard** (`dcg`) and expanded into a general-purpose destructive-command interceptor with the modular pack system.

- Initial commit ([1640612](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/commit/16406128fc967a305b97f4cd8da1b537a4be7b6f))
