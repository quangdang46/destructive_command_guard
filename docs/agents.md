# Agent-Specific Profiles

dcg can detect which AI coding agent is invoking it and apply agent-specific
trust levels and configuration overrides. This allows you to grant higher
trust to well-behaved agents while maintaining strict controls for unknown ones.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Detection Method | Environment Variable |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | Environment | `CLAUDE_CODE=1` or `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` |
| Augment Code | Environment | `AUGMENT_AGENT=1` or `AUGMENT_CONVERSATION_ID` |
| Aider | Environment | `AIDER_SESSION=1` |
| Continue | Environment | `CONTINUE_SESSION_ID` |
| Codex CLI | Environment | `CODEX_CLI=1` |
| Gemini CLI | Environment | `GEMINI_CLI=1` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Environment | `COPILOT_CLI=1` or `COPILOT_AGENT_START_TIME_SEC` |
| VS Code Copilot Chat | Hook payload | `tool_name` is `runTerminalCommand`, `run_in_terminal`, or `runInTerminal` |
| Cursor IDE | Environment | `CURSOR_IDE=1` (set by dcg's hook script) |
| Hermes Agent | Environment | `HERMES_AGENT=1` or `HERMES_SESSION_ID` |
| Grok (xAI) | Environment | `GROK_SESSION_ID`, `GROK_HOOK_EVENT`, or `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` |
| Oh My Pi (`omp`) | Explicit bridge / process | Generated extension passes `--agent omp`; exact `omp` and `oh-my-pi` process names are fallback matches |
| Pi | Environment | `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` |

## Detection Priority

Agent detection follows this priority order:

1. **Explicit `--agent` flag**: Manual override via CLI
2. **Environment variables**: Most agents set identifying env vars
3. **Parent process inspection**: Fallback check of process tree
4. **Unknown**: Default when no agent is detected

### Oh My Pi (`omp`)

Install dcg's native OMP ExtensionAPI module with:

```bash
dcg install --omp
```

The default user path is `~/.omp/agent/extensions/dcg-guard.ts`. OMP named
profiles use `~/.omp/profiles/<name>/agent/extensions/dcg-guard.ts`; dcg follows
OMP's `OMP_PROFILE`-before-`PI_PROFILE` precedence and honors
`PI_CONFIG_DIR` for a config directory name relative to the user's home plus
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` for the default profile. Drive-qualified
`PI_CONFIG_DIR` values are rejected on Windows because Rust would otherwise
resolve them differently from OMP's home-relative `path.join` behavior. Use
`dcg install --omp --project` to install `<cwd>/.omp/extensions/dcg-guard.ts`
instead. OMP checks only the current working directory for native project
extensions; it neither requires Git nor walks to an ancestor, so launch OMP
from that same directory.

The extension uses OMP's pre-execution `tool_call` event and sends each `bash`
command to `dcg --robot test --stdin --agent omp --format json` with the dialect
selected by OMP's execution route. Pinning the private bridge format prevents
ambient `DCG_FORMAT` from redirecting or invalidating its compact protocol
without removing that variable from supported environment-conditioned policy.
The embedded install-time absolute dcg pathname is authoritative: ambient
`DCG_BIN` cannot redirect the marker-owned guard. This binds a pathname, not a
hash, inode/file ID, signature, or immutable executable object. Bun resolves
that pathname again for each tool call, so moving or removing the file produces
a visible infrastructure failure, while replacing bytes at the same pathname
changes what a later callback executes. `dcg doctor` compares the marker-owned
extension with source generated for the doctor process's pathname at inspection
time; it does not attest binary contents or an extension already loaded by a
running OMP session. To rebind deliberately, run
`/desired/path/dcg install --omp --force` (add `--project` for project scope)
and restart OMP. Protect the binary, extension, and their parent directories
from writers not trusted to control OMP execution; a writer that can replace the
extension can already run code inside OMP. Ordinary and managed-async calls use
OMP's embedded Brush shell and pass `--dialect posix`, including on native
Windows. An eligible local `pty: true` call instead maps OMP's configured
external shell to `--dialect posix`, `cmd`, or `ps`; `PI_NO_PTY=1` disables that
PTY route. A dcg deny, ask, or indeterminate result returns
`{ block: true, reason }` to OMP.
Because the bridge supplies `--agent omp` explicitly, OMP remains distinct from
legacy Pi even when OMP exposes Pi-family compatibility variables. The
canonical profile key is `agents.omp`; `oh-my-pi` is accepted as an alias.
When `[history] enabled = true`, these robot-boundary evaluations are persisted
with the canonical `agent_type = "omp"`; ordinary human `dcg test` diagnostics
remain outside command history.

The bridge spawns dcg directly, without a shell, and gives Bun a 30-second
parent-side timeout with a hard kill signal. Immediately after a successful
spawn it records one monotonic absolute deadline 30.5 seconds away and arms one
observation watchdog. A direct child can exit while a descendant still holds
its stdout or stderr descriptor, so exit settlement rearms that sole timer for
the lesser of a 250-millisecond pipe-drain grace and the remaining absolute
budget. If the remaining hard budget wins, expiry retains hard-deadline
provenance. Exit-observation rejection attempts one direct-child `SIGKILL` and
uses the same clamped drain; neither rearm kills again. Every active watchdog is
cleared when observation finishes, and late exit settlement or rejection
remains consumed. There is no retry, replacement process, or second
concurrently active bridge watchdog.

This is the finite child-observation lineage:

| Current state + event | Process action | Pipe/clock action | Result invariant |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Bun.spawn` throws | No child exists | No watchdog is armed | One visible spawn diagnostic; fail open |
| Spawn succeeds | Bun owns the 30-second direct-child timeout | Record and arm the monotonic 30.5-second absolute observation deadline; read both capped pipes and exit concurrently | No classification before the bounded observation settles |
| Complete deny/ask/indeterminate frame or stdout overflow arrives | None | Retain the frame or capped overflow evidence while observation continues | Blocking evidence is absorbing |
| Exit resolves before the hard deadline | None; the direct child is already gone | Rearm for `min(250 ms, remaining hard budget)` | Bytes already read remain eligible evidence; the absolute deadline cannot move |
| Exit rejects before the hard deadline | Attempt one direct-child `SIGKILL` | Rearm for `min(250 ms, remaining hard budget)` without another kill | The exit fault and any kill fault remain visible; kill request alone does not prove a signal |
| Drain grace expires | The direct child has exited or already received the rejection-path kill | Cancel both local readers | Retained block/overflow still blocks; missing evidence follows visible infrastructure fail-open |
| Hard observation deadline expires | Attempt one direct-child `SIGKILL` | Cancel both readers and the local exit wrapper | Retained block/overflow still blocks; deadline remains visible |
| All three observations settle first | None | Clear the active watchdog | Read signal provenance, classify once, and emit each owned diagnostic once |

If a blocking frame and a deadline become runnable together, JavaScript's event
loop imposes a total order: bytes delivered before reader cancellation are
retained and absorbing; bytes delivered after cancellation are outside the
observation boundary. The stdout and stderr caps bound retained memory, and the
outer/deferred deadlines bound a standards-compliant asynchronous observation.
If an underlying WHATWG cancellation algorithm rejects, the stream is still
closed and pending reads settle; the bridge consumes the cancellation promise's
rejection while retaining prior deny/ask/indeterminate and overflow evidence.
The backstops sit above dcg's ordinary 1-second evaluator default and the broad
Windows preset's 3-second default, not in place of those configurable budgets.
An explicit evaluator budget above 30 seconds is nevertheless capped on this
OMP bridge; direct hook and diagnostic invocations retain their configured
budget.

Two seams remain fundamentally outside this in-process boundary. A synchronous
stall inside `Bun.spawn` (or any JavaScript/event-loop stall) prevents a timer
from starting or firing. Bun's `proc.kill()` targets the direct child, not a
process group, so it cannot prove that descendants were terminated or release
their unrelated resources; local reader cancellation bounds the callback even
when an inherited pipe holder survives. A non-standard stream whose synchronous
cancel path throws without settling a pending read is likewise outside the Web
Streams contract and cannot be bounded by another JavaScript promise. After
observation, the bridge reads Bun's `signalCode` and reports an exact signal
only when Bun actually exposes one; a successful `proc.kill("SIGKILL")` request
does not itself forge SIGKILL provenance. This keeps an ordinary numeric exit
137 distinct from an observed timeout or other observed `SIGKILL`.
A complete deny, ask, or indeterminate verdict already written to stdout
remains authoritative regardless of signal, cancellation, stream/exit fault,
or deadline; stdout overflow and dcg's independent blocking exit 1 are likewise
absorbing. Other abnormal statuses and infrastructure faults remain visible
even when blocking evidence controls the action.

OMP's public ExtensionAPI does not expose its ACP client-terminal capability or
selected backend, and both ACP and JSON-RPC surface as `mode: "rpc"`. The bridge
therefore does not infer a Windows dialect from mode: non-PTY RPC calls remain
POSIX-scoped so ordinary JSON-RPC execution does not gain Cmd/PowerShell false
positives. As a result, an ACP client-terminal call does not yet receive exact
Cmd/PowerShell-specific coverage; closing that residual requires OMP to expose
the actual BashTool route before the `tool_call` handler runs.

## Trust Levels

Three trust levels label how much you trust a given agent:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `high` | Agent has proven reliable; typically paired with a broader allowlist and fewer packs |
| `medium` | Default; standard configuration |
| `low` | Extra caution; typically paired with more packs and a restricted allowlist |

### How trust levels work

The `trust_level` field is an **advisory label**. It is recorded in JSON output
and shown in verbose/debug logs so you (and downstream tooling) can see what
trust tier was in effect for a given evaluation. It does **not**, by itself,
change which rules fire or how confidence scores are computed.

All behavioral differences between agents come from the other profile options
that you configure alongside the trust level:

| Option | What it does | Typical usage |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `disabled_packs` | Removes packs (and their sub-packs) from evaluation | High-trust agents that don't need certain rule sets |
| `extra_packs` | Adds packs to evaluation | Low-trust agents that should be checked against more rules |
| `additional_allowlist` | Adds command patterns that bypass deny rules | High-trust agents with known-safe build commands |
| `disabled_allowlist` | When `true`, ignores *all* allowlist entries (base + additional) | Low-trust agents that should never get a free pass |

In other words: setting `trust_level = "high"` alone does not relax any rules.
You must also adjust `disabled_packs`, `extra_packs`, `additional_allowlist`,
or `disabled_allowlist` to change evaluation behavior.

### Why the separation?

This design is intentional. Trust is not a magic knob -- different environments
need different trade-offs. A "high trust" agent in one project might need strict
database rules but relaxed filesystem rules, while in another project the
opposite applies. By keeping the label separate from the behavioral knobs, dcg
gives you full control without hidden side effects.

### Practical examples

**High-trust agent** -- a well-tested agent that runs routine build/test
commands. You widen the allowlist and disable packs that produce false positives
for its workflow:

```toml
[agents.claude-code]
trust_level = "high"
additional_allowlist = ["npm run build", "cargo test", "make lint"]
disabled_packs = ["kubernetes"]
```

**Medium-trust agent (default)** -- standard rules, no overrides:

```toml
[agents.default]
trust_level = "medium"
```

**Low-trust agent** -- an unknown or new agent. You add extra packs and disable
the allowlist so every command is evaluated against the full rule set:

```toml
[agents.unknown]
trust_level = "low"
disabled_allowlist = true
# Real pack / category IDs (see `dcg packs` / docs/packs/README.md). A category
# ID like "database" expands to every database.* sub-pack. "paranoid" is a
# graduation mode, not a pack — use the real `strict_git` pack for stricter git
# rules, and `core.filesystem` (not "filesystem") for the filesystem pack.
extra_packs = ["strict_git", "database", "system"]
```

## Configuration

Configure agent profiles in your `config.toml`:

```toml
# Trust Claude Code more (it sets CLAUDE_CODE=1)
[agents.claude-code]
trust_level = "high"
additional_allowlist = ["npm run build", "cargo test"]

[agents.omp]
trust_level = "medium"
extra_packs = ["strict_git"]

# Restrict unknown agents
[agents.unknown]
trust_level = "low"
disabled_allowlist = true
extra_packs = ["strict_git", "database"]

# Default profile for unspecified agents
[agents.default]
trust_level = "medium"
```

### Profile Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `trust_level` | string | `"medium"` | Advisory label: `"high"`, `"medium"`, or `"low"`. Included in JSON/verbose output but does not change rule evaluation by itself. |
| `disabled_packs` | array | `[]` | Pack or category IDs to remove from evaluation for this agent (a category ID drops every matching sub-pack). |
| `extra_packs` | array | `[]` | Additional pack or category IDs to enable for this agent (a category ID expands to all its sub-packs). |
| `additional_allowlist` | array | `[]` | Command patterns to allowlist for this agent (added on top of the base allowlist). |
| `disabled_allowlist` | bool | `false` | If `true`, ignore all allowlist entries for this agent (more restrictive). |

### Example: Restrictive Config for CI

```toml
# In .dcg.toml (project-level)
[agents.unknown]
trust_level = "low"
disabled_allowlist = true
extra_packs = ["strict_git", "database", "system"]

[agents.claude-code]
trust_level = "medium"
additional_allowlist = ["npm test", "npm run lint"]
```

## Custom Agents

Define profiles for custom agents by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Set a custom agent identifier
export MY_BUILD_BOT=1
```

Then configure in `config.toml`:

```toml
[agents.my-build-bot]
trust_level = "high"
additional_allowlist = ["make deploy"]
```

## Profile Resolution

When resolving which profile to use:

1. Look for exact match: `agents.<agent-config-key>`
2. Fall back to `agents.unknown` if agent is unrecognized
3. Fall back to `agents.default` if no specific profile exists

## Verbose Output

Use `--verbose` or `-v` to see agent detection info:

```bash
$ dcg test "git push --force" --verbose
Command: git push --force
...
Elapsed: 21.14ms
Agent: Claude Code
Trust level: medium
Severity: critical
```

Use `-vv` for detailed debug output:

```bash
$ dcg test "git push --force" -vv
...
Agent detection:
  Detected: Claude Code (claude-code)
  Method: environment_variable
  Matched: CLAUDE_CODE
  Profile: agents.claude-code
  Trust level: medium
```

## JSON Output

The `--format json` output includes agent information:

```json
{
  "command": "git push --force",
  "decision": "deny",
  "agent": {
    "detected": "claude-code",
    "trust_level": "medium",
    "detection_method": "environment_variable"
  }
}
```

## Robot Mode

Robot mode provides a unified, machine-friendly interface for AI agents. When
enabled, dcg optimizes its output for programmatic consumption.

### Enabling Robot Mode

```bash
# Via flag
dcg --robot test "rm -rf /"

# Via environment variable
DCG_ROBOT=1 dcg test "rm -rf /"
```

### Robot Mode Behavior

| Aspect | Normal Mode | Robot Mode |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| stdout | JSON or pretty | Always JSON |
| stderr | Rich colored output | Silent |
| Exit codes | Varies | Standardized |
| ANSI codes | If TTY | Never |
| Progress | Shown | Hidden |
| Suggestions | Shown | In JSON only |

### Standardized Exit Codes

In robot mode, dcg uses consistent exit codes across all commands:

| Code | Constant | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| 0 | `EXIT_SUCCESS` | Success / Allow |
| 1 | `EXIT_DENIED` | Command denied/blocked |
| 2 | `EXIT_WARNING` | Warning (with --fail-on warn) |
| 3 | `EXIT_CONFIG_ERROR` | Configuration error |
| 4 | `EXIT_PARSE_ERROR` | Parse/input error |
| 5 | `EXIT_IO_ERROR` | IO error |

### Robot Mode JSON Output

All robot-mode responses are pure JSON on stdout:

```json
{
  "command": "rm -rf /",
  "decision": "deny",
  "rule_id": "core.filesystem:rm-rf-root",
  "pack_id": "core.filesystem",
  "severity": "critical",
  "reason": "rm -rf / would delete the entire filesystem",
  "agent": {
    "detected": "claude-code",
    "trust_level": "medium",
    "detection_method": "environment_variable"
  }
}
```

### Hook Mode vs Robot Mode

**Hook mode** (default when no subcommand) follows the active hook protocol:
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot Chat, and compatible JSON-hook protocols emit
  JSON on stdout for denials and empty stdout for allows.
- Codex CLI uses strict hook parsing, so dcg emits a minimal
  `hookSpecificOutput` denial on stdout and exits 0.
- Rich output always goes to stderr for human visibility.

**Robot mode** with subcommands uses standardized exit codes:
- Exit 1 for denials (allows scripting with `$?`)
- Pure JSON on stdout
- Silent stderr

## Rich Output and Agent Compatibility

dcg keeps agent-facing output and human-facing output on separate streams. This
is the compatibility contract for rich terminal formatting.

| Stream | Purpose | Hook-mode content | Robot-mode content |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| stdout | Agent and script parsing | Protocol JSON for denials, empty for allows | JSON only |
| stderr | Human-visible diagnostics | Rich or plain text warning boxes | Silent |

Rich output is display-only. It must never be parsed by agents and must never be
written to stdout. When dcg prints Unicode boxes, colors, highlighted commands,
or suggestion panels, that output belongs on stderr.

### Rich Output Selection

dcg uses rich terminal formatting only when the runtime is suitable. It falls
back to plain output when any of these controls are active:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `DCG_NO_RICH=1` | Disable rich formatting while keeping normal command behavior |
| `--legacy-output` or `DCG_LEGACY_OUTPUT=1` | Force legacy/plain rendering paths |
| `NO_COLOR=1` or `DCG_NO_COLOR=1` | Disable colorized output |
| `TERM=dumb` | Use dumb-terminal-safe output |
| `CI=1` | Suppress rich interactive formatting in CI |
| non-TTY stdout | Prefer plain output for pipeline-friendly behavior |
| `--robot` or `DCG_ROBOT=1` | Emit machine-readable stdout and keep stderr silent |

### Wrapper Guidance

Agent wrappers should choose the interface that matches their parser:

```bash
# Hook integration: preserve both streams.
dcg < hook-input.json >hook-stdout.json 2>human-warning.txt

# Scripting integration: use robot mode and parse stdout only.
dcg --robot test "rm -rf /" >decision.json 2>/dev/null
```

For Codex and Claude-compatible hook integrations, parse stdout when it is
non-empty and treat empty stdout with exit 0 as allow. Codex's denial payload is
minimal and intentionally omits dcg-only metadata.

### Example: Agent Integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script for AI agent to check commands before execution

check_command() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local result

    # Use robot mode for predictable output
    result=$(dcg --robot test "$cmd" 2>/dev/null)
    local exit_code=$?

    if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Command allowed: $cmd"
        return 0
    elif [ $exit_code -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Command BLOCKED: $cmd"
        echo "Reason: $(echo "$result" | jq -r '.reason')"
        return 1
    else
        echo "Error checking command (exit code: $exit_code)"
        return $exit_code
    fi
}

# Usage
check_command "git status"      # Allowed
check_command "rm -rf /"        # Blocked
```

### Unified Output Format

Robot mode uses the unified `OutputFormat` enum:

```bash
# These are equivalent in robot mode
dcg --robot test "cmd"
dcg --robot --format json test "cmd"
```

Available formats:
- `pretty` / `text` / `human` - Human-readable (default without --robot)
- `json` / `sarif` / `structured` - JSON output (default with --robot)
- `jsonl` - JSON Lines (one object per line, for streaming)
- `compact` - Compact single-line output

## Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults**: The default `medium` trust level is safe for most
   use cases.

2. **Grant trust incrementally**: Only increase trust for agents after
   observing their behavior.

3. **Use project-level configs**: Put agent profiles in `.dcg.toml` so they're
   version-controlled with your project.

4. **Restrict unknown agents**: Always configure `agents.unknown` with lower
   trust in production environments.

5. **Review the JSON output**: Use `--format json` in CI to audit which agents
   are accessing your codebase.

6. **Use robot mode for scripting**: When integrating dcg into automated
   workflows, use `--robot` for consistent, parseable output.

7. **Check exit codes**: In robot mode, use exit codes to make decisions
   without parsing JSON for simple allow/deny checks.
